<P class="spaced">MY DEAR FRIEND,</P>

<P>Most grateful it is to me, at all times, to bear in remembrance
those pleasant discussions in which we were wont so frequently to
indulge, relating to the LIBRARIES upon the Continent:--but more
than ordinarily gratifying to me was <EM>that</EM> moment, when you
told me, that, on crossing the Rhine, you took the third volume of
my Tour under your arm, and on reaching the Monasteries of Mölk and
Göttwic, gave an off-hand translation to the venerable Benedictine
Inmates of what I had recorded concerning their MSS. and Printed
Books, and their hospitable reception of the Author. I studiously
concealed from You, at the time, the whole of the gratification
which that intelligence imparted; resolving however that, should
this work be deemed worthy of a second edition, to dedicate that
republication to YOURSELF. Accordingly, it now comes forth in its
present form, much enhanced, in the estimation of its Author, by
the respectability of the name prefixed to this Dedication; and
wishing you many years enjoyment of the honourable public situation
with which you have been recently, and so deservedly, invested,
allow me to subscribe myself,</P>

<P>Your affectionate<BR>
and obliged Friend,</P>

<P>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</P>

<P>If I had chosen to introduce myself to the greatest possible
advantage to the reader, in this Preface to a Second Edition of the
&quot;<EM>Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and Picturesque
Tour</EM>,&quot; I could not have done better than have borrowed
the language of those Foreigners, who, by a translation of the Work
(however occasionally vituperative their criticisms) have, in fact,
conferred an honour upon its Author. In the midst of censure,
sometimes dictated by spite, and sometimes sharpened by acrimony of
feeling, it were in my power to select passages of commendation,
which would not less surprise the Reader than they have done
myself: while the history of this performance may be said to
exhibit the singular phenomenon, of a traveller, usually lauding
the countries through which he passes, receiving in return the
reluctant approbation of those whose institutions, manners, and
customs, have been praised by him. It is admitted, by the most
sedulous and systematic of my opponents--M. CRAPELET--that
&quot;considering the quantity and quality of the ornaments and
engravings of this Tour, one is surprised that its cost is so
moderate.&quot;<A name="fnref_1"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_1">1</A></P>

<P>&quot;Few books (says the Bibliographer of Dijon) have been
executed with greater luxury. It is said that the expenses of
printing and engraving amounted to 6000 l.--to nearly 140,000
franks of our money. It must be admitted that England is the only
country in which such an undertaking could be carried into effect.
Who in France would dare to risk such a sum-- especially for three,
volumes in octavo? He would be ruined, if he did.&quot;<A name=
"fnref_2"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_2">2</A> I quote these
passages simply to shew under what extraordinary obliquity of
feeling those gentlemen must have set down to the task of
translation and abuse--of THAT VERY WORK, which is here admitted to
contain such splendid representations of the &quot;bibliographical,
antiquarian, and picturesque&quot; beauties of their country.</P>

<P>A brief account of this foreign <EM>travail</EM> may be
acceptable to the curious in literary history. MONS. LICQUET, the
successor of M. Gourdin, as Chief Librarian to the Public Library
at Rouen, led the way in the work of warfare. He translated the
ninth Letter relating to that Public Library; of which translation
especial mention is made at p. 99, post. This version was printed
in 1821, for private, distribution; and only 100 copies were struck
off. M. Crapelet, in whose office it was printed, felt the embers
of discontent rekindled in his bosom as it passed through his
press; and in the following year HE also stepped forward to
discharge an arrow at the Traveller. Like his predecessor, he
printed but a limited number; and as I have more particularly
remarked upon the spirit of that version by way of
&quot;Introduction&quot; to the original letter, in vol. ii. 209,
&amp;c. I shall not waste the time of the Reader by any notice of
it in the present place. These two partial translators united their
forces, about two years afterwards, and published the whole of the
Tour, as it related to FRANCE, in four octavo volumes, in 1825. The
ordinary copies were sold for 48 francs, the large paper for 112
francs per copy. The wood-cuts only were republished by them. Of
this conjoint, and more enlarged production, presently.</P>

<P>Encouraged by the examples of Messrs. Licquet and Crapelet, a
Bookbinder of the name of LESNÉ (whose poem upon his
&quot;Craft,&quot; published in 1820, had been copiously quoted and
<EM>commended</EM> by me in the previous edition) chose to plant
his foot within this arena of controversy; and to address a letter
to me; to which his model, M. Crapelet, was too happy to give
circulation through the medium of his press.<A name=
"fnref_3"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_3">3</A> To that letter
the following metrical lines are prefixed; which the Reader would
scarcely forgive me if I failed to amuse him by their introduction
in this place. &quot;<EM>Lesné, Relieur Français, à Mons. T.F.
Dibdin, Ministre de la Religion, &amp;c.</EM>&quot;</P>

<P class="poetry">Avec un ris moqueur, je crois vous voir
d&#39;ici,<BR>
 Dédaigneusement dire: Eh, que veut celui-ci?<BR>
 Qu&#39;ai-je donc de commun avec un vil artiste?<BR>
 Un ouvrier français, un <EM>Bibliopégiste</EM>?<BR>
 Ose-t-on ravaler un Ministre à ce point?<BR>
 Que me veut ce <EM>Lesné</EM>? Je ne le connais point.<BR>
 <SPAN class="ind2">Je crois me souvenir qu&#39;à mon voyage en
France,</SPAN><BR>
 Avec ses pauvres vers je nouai connaissance.<BR>
 Mais c&#39;est si peu de chose un poète à Paris!<BR>
 <SPAN class="ind2">Savez-vous bien, Monsieur, pourquoi je vous
écris?</SPAN><BR>
 C&#39;est que je crois avoir le droit de vous écrire.<BR>
 Fussiez-vous cent fois plus qu&#39;on ne saurait le dire,<BR>
 Je vois dans un Ministre un homme tel que moi;<BR>
 Devant Dieu je crois même être l&#39;égal d&#39;un roi.</P>

<P>The Letter however is in prose, with some very few exceptions;
and it is just possible that the indulgent Reader may endure a
specimen or two of the prose of M. Lesné, as readily as he has that
of his poetry. These specimens are equally delectable, of their
kind. Immediately after the preceding poetical burst, the French
Bibliopegist continues thus:</P>

<P class="quote">D&#39;après cet exorde, vous pensez sans doute
que, bien convaincu de ma dignité d&#39;homme, je me crois en droit
de vous dire franchement ma façon de penser; je vous la dirai,
Monsieur. Si vous dirigiez un journal bibliographique; que vous
fissiez, en un mot, le métier de journaliste, je serai peu surpris
de voir dans votre Trentième Lettre, une foule de choses hasardées,
de mauvais calembourgs, de grossièretés, que nous ne rencontrons
même pas chez nos journalistes du dernier ordre, en ce qu&#39;ils
savent mieux leur monde, et que s&#39;ils lancent une epigramme,
fût-elle fausse, elle est au moins finement tournée. Mais vous êtes
ANGLAIS, et par cela seul dispensé sans doute de cette politesse
qui distingue si heureusement notre nation de la vôtre, et que vos
compatriotes n&#39;acquièrent pour la plupart qu&#39;après un long
séjour en France.&quot; p. 6.</P>

<P>Towards the latter part of this most formidable &quot;Tentamen
Criticum,&quot; the irritable author breaks out
thus--&quot;C&#39;est une maladie Française de vouloir toujours
imiter les Anglais; ceux-ci, à leur tour, commencent à en être
atteints.&quot; p. 19. A little farther it is thus: &quot;Enfin
c&#39;est <EM>en imitant</EM> qu&#39;on reussit presque toujours
mal; vous en êtes encore, une preuve évidente. J&#39;ai vu en
beaucoup d&#39;endroits de votre Lettre, que vous avez voulu imiter
<EM>Sterne</EM>;<A name="fnref_4"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_4">4</A> qu&#39;est-il arrivé? Vous êtes resté au- dessous de
lui, comme tous les Imitateurs de nôtre bon La Fontaine sont restés
en deçà de l&#39;immortel Fabuliste.&quot; p. 20. But most
especially does the sensitive M. Lesné betray his surprise and
apprehension, on a gratuitous supposition--thrown out by me, by way
of pleasantry--that &quot;Mr. Charles Lewis was going over to
Paris, to establish there a modern School of Bookbinding.&quot; M.
Lesné thus wrathfully dilates upon this supposition:</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;Je me garderai bien de passer sous silence
la dernière partie de votre Lettre; <EM>un bruit assez étrange est
venu jusqu&#39;à vous</EM>; et Charles Lewis doit vous quitter pour
quelque temps pour établir en France une école de reliure
d&#39;apres les principes du gôut anglais; mais vous croyez,
dites-vous, que ce projet est sûrement chimérique, ou que, si on le
tentait, il serait de courte durée.</P>

<P class="quote">Pour cette fois, Monsieur, votre pronostic serait
très juste; cette demarche serait une folie: il faudrait
s&#39;abuser sur l&#39;engouement des amateurs français, et ceux
qui sont atteints de cette maladie ne sont pas en assez grand
nombre pour soutenir un pareil établissement. Oui, l&#39;on aime
votre genre de reliure; mais on aime les reliures, façon anglaise,
faites par les Français. Pensez-vous done, ou Charles Lewis
pense-t-il, qu&#39;il n&#39;y ait plus d&#39;esprit national en
France?</P>

<P class="quotepoetry">Allez, le sang Française coule encore dans
nos veines;<BR>
 Nous pourrons éprouver des malheurs et des peines,<BR>
 Que nous devrons peut être à vous autres Anglais;<BR>
 Mais nous voulons rester, nous resterons, Français!</P>

<P class="quote">Ainsi, que Charles Lewis ne se dérange pas;
qu&#39;il cesse, s&#39;il les a commencés, les préparatifs de sa
descente; qu&#39;il ne prive pas ses compatriotes d&#39;un artiste
soi-disant inimitable. Nous en avons ici qui le valent, et qui se
feront un plaisir de perpéteur parmi nous le bon gôut,
l&#39;élégance, et la noble simplicité. p. 25.<A name=

<P>So much for M. Lesne. I have briefly noticed M. Peignot, the
Bibliographer of Dijon. That worthy wight has made the versions of
my Ninth and Thirtieth Letters (First Edition) by M.M. Licquet and
Crapelet, the substratum of his first brochure entitled
<EM>Variétés, Notices et Raretés Bibliographiques</EM>,
<EM>Paris</EM>, 1822: it being a supplement to his previous Work of
<EM>Curiosités Bibliographiques</EM>.&quot;<A name="fnref_6"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_6">6</A> It is not always agreeable for an
Author to have his Works reflected through the medium of a
translation; especially where the Translator suffers a portion,
however small, of his <EM>own</EM> atrabiliousness, to be mixed up
with the work translated: nor is it always safe for a third person
to judge of the merits of the original through such a medium. Much
allowance must therefore be made for M. Peignot; who, to say the
truth, at the conclusion of his labours, seems to think that he has
waded through a great deal of <EM>dirt</EM> of some kind or other,
which might have been better avoided; and that, in consequence,
some general declaration, by way of <EM>wiping, off</EM> a portion
of the adhering mud, is due to the original Author. Accordingly, at
the end of his analysis of M. Licquet&#39;s version, (which forms
the second Letter in the brochure) he does me the honour to devote
seven pages to the notice of my humble lucubrations:--and he
prefaces this &quot;<EM>Notice des Ouvrages de M.
Dibdin&quot;</EM>, by the following very handsome tribute to their
worth:</P>

<P class="quote">Si, dans les deux Lettres où nous avons rendu
compte des traductions partielles du voyage de M.D., nous avons
partagé l&#39;opinion des deux estimable traducteurs, sur quelques
erreurs et quelques inconvenances échappées a l&#39;auteur anglais,
nous sommes bien éloigné d&#39;envelopper dans le même blame, tout
ce qui est sorté de sa plume; car il y auroit injustice a lui
refuser des connaissances très étendues en histoire littéraire, et
en bibliographie: nous le disons franchement, il faudroit fermer
les yeux à la lumière, ou être d&#39;une partialité revoltante,
pour ne pas convenir que, juste appréciateur de tous les trésors
bibliographiques qu&#39;il a le bonheur d&#39;avoir sous la main,
M. Dibdin en a fait connoitre en détail toute la richesse dans de
nombreux d&#39;ouvrages, ou très souvent le luxe d&#39;érudition se
trouve en harmonie avec le luxe typographique qu&#39;il y a
étalé.</P>

<P>At the risk of incurring the imputation of vanity, I annex the
preceding extract; because I am persuaded that the candid Reader
will appreciate it in its proper light. I might, had I chosen to do
so, have lengthened the extract by a yet more complimentary
passage: but enough of M. Peignot--who, so far from suffering ill
will or acerbity to predominate over a kind disposition, hath been
pleased, since his publication, to write to me a very courteous
Letter,<A name="fnref_7"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_7">7</A>
and to solicit a &quot;continuance of my favours.&quot;</P>

<P>Agreeably to the intimation expressed in a preceding page, I am
now, in due order, to notice the labours of my translators M.M.
LICQUET and CRAPELET. Their united version appeared in 1825, in
four octavo volumes, of which the small paper was but indifferently
well printed.<A name="fnref_8"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_8">8</A> The preface to the first two volumes is by M.
Licquet: and it is not divested of point and merit. It begins by
attacking the <EM>Quarterly Review</EM>, (June 1821, p. 147.) for
its severity of animadversion on the supposed listlessness and want
of curiosity of the French in exploring the architectural
antiquities of their country; and that, in consequence of such
supineness, the English, considering them as their own property,
have described them accordingly. &quot;The decision (says the
French translator) is severe; happily it is without
foundation.&quot; After having devoted several pages to
observations by way of reply to that critical Journal, M. Licquet
continues thus:--unless I have unintentionally misrepresented
him.</P>

<P class="quote">The Englishman who travels in Normandy, meets, at
every step, with reminiscences of his kings, his ancestors, his
institutions, and his customs. Churches yet standing, after the
lapse of seven centuries; majestic ruins; tombs--even to the very
sound of the clock--all unite in affecting, here, the heart of a
British subject: every thing seems to tell him that, in former
times, HERE was his country; here the residence of his sovereigns;
and here the cradle of his manners. This was more than sufficient
to enflame the lively imagination of Mr. D. and to decide him to
visit, in person, a country already explored by a great number of
his countrymen; but he conceived that his narrative should embody
other topics than those which ordinarily appeared in the text of
his predecessors.</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;His work then is not only a description of
castles, towns, churches, public monuments of every kind:--it is
not only a representation of the general aspect of the country, as
to its picturesque appearances-- but it is an extended, minute,
though occasionally inexact, account of public and private
libraries; with reflections upon certain customs of the country,
and upon the character of those who inhabit it. It is in short the
personal history of the author, throughout the whole length of his
journey. Not the smallest incident, however indifferent, but what
has a place in the letters of the Bibliographer. Thus, he mentions
every Inn where he stops: recommends or scolds the landlord--
according to his civility or exaction. Has the author passed a bad
night? the reader is sure to know it on the following morning. On
the other hand, has he had a good night&#39;s rest in a comfortable
bed? [dans un lit <EM>comfortable</EM>?] We are as sure to know
this also, as soon as he awakes:--and thus far we are relieved from
anxiety about the health of the traveller. Cold and heat--fine
weather and bad weather-- every variation of atmosphere is
scrupulously recorded.</P>

<P>What immediately follows, is unworthy of M. Licquet; because it
not only implies a charge of a heinous description--accusing me of
an insidious intrusion into domestic circles, a violation of
confidence, and a systematic derision of persons and things--but
because the French translator, exercising that sense and shrewdness
which usually distinguish him, MUST have known that such a charge
<EM>could</EM> not have been founded in FACT. He must have known
that any gentleman, leaving England with those letters which
brought me in contact with some of the first circles on the
Continent, MUST have left it without leaving his character
<EM>behind</EM> him; and that such a character could not, in the
natural order of things-- seen even through the sensitive medium of
a French critic--have been guilty of the grossness and
improprieties imputed to me by M. Licquet. I treat therefore this
&quot;damnation in wholesale&quot; with scorn and contempt: and
hasten to impress the reader with a more favourable opinion of my
Norman translator. He <EM>will</EM> have it that</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;the English Traveller&#39;s imagination is
lively and ardent--and his spirit, that of raillery and lightness.
He examines as he runs along; that is to say, he does not give
himself time to examine; he examines ill; he deceives himself; and
he subjects his readers to be deceived with him. He traverses, at a
hard trot, one of the most ancient towns in France; puts his head
out of his carriage window--and boldly decides that the town is of
the time of Francis I.&quot;!<A name="fnref_9"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_9">9</A> p. xviij.</P>

<P>There is pleasantry, and perhaps some little truth, in this vein
of observation; and it had been better, perhaps, for the credit of
the good taste and gentleman-like feeling of Mons. Licquet, if he
had uniformly maintained his character in these respects. I have
however, in the subsequent pages,<A name="fnref_10"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_10">10</A> occasionally grappled with my
annotator in proving the fallacy, or the want of charity, of many
of his animadversions: and the reader probably may not be
displeased, if, by way of &quot;avant propos,&quot; I indulge him
here with a specimen of them--taken from his preface. M. Licquet
says, that I &quot;create scenes; arrange a drama; trace
characters; imagine a dialogue, frequently in French--and in what
French--gracious God!--in assigning to postilions a ridiculous
language, and to men of the world the language of postilions.&quot;
These be sharp words:<A name="fnref_11"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_11">11</A> but what does the Reader imagine may be the
probable &quot;result&quot; of the English Traveller&#39;s
inadvertencies?... A result, (&quot;gracious Heaven!&quot;) very
little anticipated by the author. Let him ponder well upon the
awful language which ensues. &quot;What (says M. Licquet) will
quickly be the result, with us, of such indiscretions as those of
which M. Dibdin is guilty? The necessity of SHUTTING OUR PORTS, or
at least of placing a GUARD UPON OUR LIPS!&quot; There is some
consolation however left for me, in balancing this tremendous
denunciation by M. Licquet&#39;s eulogy of my good qualities--which
a natural diffidence impels me to quote in the original words of
their author.</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;A Dieu ne plaise, toutefois, que
j&#39;accuse ici LE COEUR de M. Dibdin. Je n&#39;ai jamais eu
l&#39;honneur de le voir: je ne le connais que par ses ecrits;
principalement par son <EM>Splendid Tour</EM>, et je ne balance pas
à déclarer que l&#39;auteur doit être doué d&#39;une ame honnête,
et de ces qualités fondamentales qui constituent l&#39;homme de
bien. Il préfère sa croyance; mais il respecte la croyance des
autres; son érudition parait....<A name="fnref_12"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_12">12</A> variée. Son amour pour les antiquités
est immense; et par antiquités j&#39;entends ici tout ce qui est
<EM>antique</EM> ou seulement <EM>ancien</EM>, quellesque soient
d&#39;ailleurs la nature et la forme des objets.&quot; Pref. p. xv.
xvij.</P>

<P>Once more; and to conclude with M. Licquet. After these general
observations upon the <EM>Text</EM> of the Tour, M. Licquet favours
us with the following--upon the <EM>Plates</EM>. &quot;These plates
(says he) are intended to represent some of the principal
monuments; the most beautiful landscapes, and the most remarkable
persons, comprehending even the servants of an inn. If
<EM>talent</EM> be sought in these Engravings, it will doubtless be
found in them; but strangers must not seek for <EM>fidelity</EM> of
representation from what is before their eyes. The greater number
of the Designs are, in some sort, ideal compositions, which, by
resembling every thing, resemble nothing in particular: and it is
worthy of remark that the Artist, in imitation of the Author, seems
to have thought that he had only to shew himself <EM>clever</EM>,
without troubling himself to be <EM>faithful</EM>.&quot; To this, I
reply in the very words of M. Licquet himself: &quot;the decision
is severe; luckily it is unjust.&quot; The only portions of the
designs of their skilful author, which may be taxed with a tendency
to extravagance, are the <EM>groups</EM>: which, when accompanied
by views of landscapes, or of monuments, are probably too profusely
indulged in; but the <EM>individuals</EM>, constituting those
groups, belong precisely to the <EM>country</EM> in which they are
represented. In the first and second volumes they are
<EM>French</EM>; in the third they are <EM>Germans</EM>--all over.
Will M. Licquet pretend to say that the churches, monasteries,
streets, and buildings, with which the previous Edition of this
Tour is so elaborately embellished, have the slightest tendency to
IMAGINED SCENERY? If he do, his optics must be peculiarly his own.
I have, in a subsequent page, (p. 34, note) slightly alluded to the
cost and risk attendant on the Plates; but I may confidently
affirm, from experience, that two thirds of the expense incurred
would have secured the same sale at the same price. However, the
die is cast; and the voice of lamentation is fruitless.</P>

<P>I now come to the consideration of M. Licquet&#39;s coadjutor,
M. CRAPELET. Although the line of conduct pursued by that very
singular gentleman be of an infinitely more crooked description
than that of his Predecessor, yet, in this place, I shall observe
less respecting it; inasmuch as, in the subsequent pages, (pp. 209,
245, 253, 400, &amp;c.) the version and annotations of M. Crapelet
have been somewhat minutely discussed. Upon the SPIRIT which could
give rise to such a version, and such annotations, I will here only
observe, that it very much resembles that of searchers of our
street-pavements; who, with long nails, scrape out the dirt from
the interstices of the stones, with the hope of making a discovery
of some lost treasure which may compensate the toil of
perseverance. The love of lucre may, or may not, have influenced my
Parisian translator; but the love of discovery of latent error, and
of exposure of venial transgression, has undoubtedly, from
beginning to end, excited his zeal and perseverance. That carping
spirit, which shuts its eyes upon what is liberal and kind, and
withholds its assent to what is honourable and just, it is the
distinguished lot--and, perhaps, as the translator may imagine, the
distinguished felicity--of M. Crapelet to possess. Never was
greater reluctance displayed in admitting even the palpable truths
of a text, than what is displayed in the notes of M. Crapelet: and
whenever a concurring sentiment comes from him, it seems to exude
like his heart&#39;s life-blood. Having already answered, in
detail, his separate publication confined to my 30th Letter<A name=
"fnref_13"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_13">13</A>--(the 8th of
the second volume, in <EM>this</EM> edition) and having replied to
those animadversions which appear in his translation of the whole
of the second volume, in this edition--it remains here only to
consign the Translator to the careful and impartial consideration
of the Reader, who, it is requested, may be umpire between both
parties. Not to admit that the text of this Edition is in many
places improved, from the suggestions of my Translators, by
corrections of &quot;Names of Persons, Places, and Things,&quot;
would be to betray a stubbornness or obtuseness of feeling which
certainly does not enter into the composition of its author.</P>

<P>I now turn, not without some little anxiety, yet not wholly
divested of the hope of a favourable issue, to the character and
object of the Edition HERE presented to the Public. It will be
evident, at first glance, that it is greatly &quot;shorn of its
beams&quot; in regard to graphic decorations and typographical
splendour. Yet its garb, if less costly, is not made of coarse
materials: for it has been the wish and aim of the Publishers, that
this impression should rank among books worthy of the DISTINGUISHED
PRESS from which it issues. Nor is it unadorned by the sister art
of <EM>Engraving</EM>; for, although on a reduced scale, some of
the repeated plates may even dispute the palm of superiority with
their predecessors. Several of the GROUPS, executed on
<EM>copper</EM> in the preceding edition, have been executed on
<EM>wood</EM> in the present; and it is for the learned in these
matters to decide upon their relative merits. To have attempted
portraits upon wood, would have inevitably led to failure. There
are however, a few NEW PLATES, which cannot fail to elicit the
Purchaser&#39;s particular attention. Of these, the portraits of
the <EM>Abbé de la Rue</EM> (procured through the kind offices of
my excellent friend Mr. Douce), and the <EM>Comte de Brienne</EM>,
the <EM>Gold Medal of Louis XII</EM>. the <EM>Stone Pulpit of
Strasbourg Cathedral,</EM> and the <EM>Prater near Vienna</EM>--are
particularly to be noticed.<A name="fnref_14"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_14">14</A> This Edition has also another attraction,
rather popular in the present day, which may add to its
recommendation even with those possessed of its precursor. It
contains fac- similes of the AUTOGRAPHS of several distinguished
Literati and Artists upon the Continent;<A name="fnref_15"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_15">15</A> who, looking at the text of the
work through a less jaundiced medium than the Parisian translator,
have continued a correspondence with the Author, upon the most
friendly terms, since its publication. The accuracy of these
fac-similes must be admitted, even by the parties themselves, to be
indisputable. Among them, are several, executed by hands.. which
now CEASE to guide the pen! I had long and fondly hoped to have
been gratified by increasing testimonies of the warmth of heart
which had directed several of the pens in question--hoped ... even
against the admonition of a pagan poet ...</P>

<P class="poetry">&quot;Vitae summa brevis SPEM nos vetat inchoare
LONGAM.&quot;</P>

<P>But such hopes are now irretrievably cut off; and the
remembrance of the past must solace the anticipations of the
future.</P>

<P>So much respecting the <EM>decorative</EM> department of this
new edition of the Tour. I have now to request the Reader&#39;s
attention to a few points more immediately connected with what may
be considered its <EM>intrinsic</EM> worth. In the first place, it
may be pronounced to be an Edition both <EM>abridged</EM> and
<EM>enlarged</EM>: abridged, as regards the lengthiness of
description of many of the MSS. and Printed Books--and enlarged, as
respects the addition, of many notes; partly of a controversial,
and partly of an obituary, description. The &quot;Antiquarian and
Picturesque&quot; portions remain nearly as heretofore; and upon
the whole I doubt whether the amputation of matter has extended
beyond <EM>an eighth</EM> of what appeared in the previous edition.
It had long ago been suggested to me--from a quarter too high and
respectable to doubt the wisdom of its decision--that the Contents
of this Tour should be made known to the Public through a less
costly medium:--that the objects described in it were, in a
measure, new and interesting--but that the high price of the
purchase rendered it, to the majority of Readers, an inaccessible
publication. I hope that these objections are fully met, and
successfully set aside, by the Work in its PRESENT FORM. To have
produced it, <EM>wholly divested</EM> of ornament, would have been
as foreign to my habits as repugnant to my feelings. I have
therefore, as I would willingly conclude, hit upon the happy
medium-- between sterility and excess of decoration.</P>

<P>After all, the greater part of the ground here trodden, yet
continues to be untrodden ground to the public. I am not acquainted
with any publication which embraces all the objects here described;
nor can I bring myself to think that a perusal of the first and
third volumes may not be unattended with gratification of a
peculiar description, to the lovers of antiquities and picturesque
beauties. The second volume is rather the exclusive province of the
Bibliographer. In retracing the steps here marked out, I will not
be hypocrite enough to dissemble a sort of triumphant feeling which
accompanies a retrospection of the time, labour, and money
devoted.. in doing justice, according to my means, to the
attractions and worth of the Countries which these pages describe.
Every such effort is, in its way, a NATIONAL effort. Every such
attempt unites, in stronger bonds, the reciprocities of a generous
feeling between rival Nations; and if my reward has not been in
<EM>wealth</EM>, it has been in the hearty commendation of the
enlightened and the good: &quot;Mea me virtute involvo.&quot;<A
name="fnref_16"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_16">16</A></P>

<P>I cannot boast of the commendatory strains of public Journals in
my own country. No intellectual steam-engine has been put in motion
to manufacture a review of unqualified approbation of the Work now
submitted to the public eye--at an expense, commensurate with the
ordinary means of purchase. With the exception of an indirect and
laudatory notice of it, in the immortal pages of the Author of
Waverley, of the Sketch book, and of Reginald Dalton, this Tour has
had to fight its way under the splendour of its own banners, and in
the strength of its own cause. The previous Edition is now a scarce
and a costly book. Its Successor has enough to recommend it, even
to the most fastidious collector, from the elegance of its type and
decorations, and from the reasonableness of its price; but the
highest ambition of its author is, that it may be a part of the
furniture of every Circulating Library in the Kingdom. If he were
not conscious that GOOD would result from its perusal, he would not
venture upon such an avowal. &quot;FELIX FAUSTUMQUE SIT!&quot;</P>

<P>PASSAGE TO DIEPPE.</P>

<P><EM>Dieppe, April 20, 1818.</EM></P>

<P>At length then, my dear Friend, the long projected
&quot;<EM>Bibliographical, Antiquarian</EM>,<A name=
"fnref_17"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_17">17</A> and
<EM>Picturesque Tour&quot;</EM> is carried into execution; and the
Tourist is safely landed on the shores of Normandy. &quot;Vous
voilà donc, Monsieur à Dieppe!&quot;--exclaimed the landlord of the
Grand Hôtel d&#39;Angleterre--as I made my way through a
vociferating crowd of old and young, of both sexes, with cards of
addresses in their hands; entreating me to take up my abode at
their respective hotels.... But I know your love of method, and
that you will be angry with me if I do not &quot;begin at the
beginning.&quot;</P>

<P>It was surely on one of the finest of all fine days that I left
my home, on the 14th of this present month, for the land of
castles, churches, and ancient chivalry. The wind from the
south-east was blowing pretty smartly at the time; but the sky was
without a cloud, and I could not but look upon the brilliancy of
every external object as a favourable omen of the progress and
termination of my tour. Adverse winds, or the indolence or
unwillingness of the Captain, detained us at Brighton two whole
days-- instead of sailing, as we were led to expect, on the day
following our arrival. We were to form the first ship&#39;s company
which had visited France this season. On approaching our gallant
little bark, the <EM>Nancy</EM>,<A name="fnref_18"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_18">18</A> commanded by Captain BLABER, the
anchor was weighed, and hoisting sail, we stood out to sea. The day
began to improve upon us. The gloomy appearances of the morning
gradually brightened up. A host of black clouds rolled heavily
away. The sun at length shone in his full meridian splendour, and
the ocean sparkled as we cut through its emerald waves. As I
supposed us to near the French coast, I strained my eyes to obtain
an early glimpse of something in the shape of cliff or jettie. But
the wind continued determinedly in the south east: the waves rose
in larger masses; and our little vessel threw up a heavy shower of
foam as we entered on the various tacks.</P>

<P>It is a grand sight--that vast, and apparently interminable
ocean--</P>

<P class="poetry">.... maria undique et undique coelum!</P>

<P>We darted from Beechy Head upon a long tack for the French
coast: and as the sun declined, we found it most prudent to put the
Captain&#39;s advice, of going below, into execution. Then
commenced all the miseries of the voyage. The moon had begun to
assert her ascendancy, when, racked with torture and pain in our
respective berths, a tremendous surge washed completely over the
deck, sky-light, and binnacle: and down came, in consequence,
drenched with the briny wave, the hardiest of our crew, who, till
then, had ventured to linger upon deck. That crew was various; and
not without a few of the natives of those shores which we were
about to visit.</P>

<P>To cut short my ship-narrative, suffice it only farther to say,
that, towards midnight, we heard our Captain exclaim that he saw
&quot;the lights of Dieppe&quot;--a joyful sound to us miserable
wretches below. I well remember, at this moment, looking up towards
the deck with a cheerless eye, and perceiving the light of the moon
still lingering upon the main-sail,--but I shall never forget how
much more powerfully my sensations were excited, when, as the dawn
of day made objects visible, I looked up, and saw an old
wrinkle-visaged sailor, with a red night cap on begirt with large
blue, puckered, short petticoats--in possession of the helm--about
to steer the vessel into harbour!<A name="fnref_19"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_19">19</A></P>

<P>About seven we were all upon deck. The sea was yet swoln and
agitated, and of a dingy colour: while</P>

<P class="poetry">.... heavily with clouds came on the day,</P>

<P>as we slowly approached the outward harbour of DIEPPE. A grey
morning with drizzling rain, is not the best accompaniment of a
first visit to a foreign shore. Nevertheless every thing was new,
and strange, and striking; and the huge crucifix, to the right, did
not fail to make a very forcible impression. As we approached the,
inner harbour, the shipping and the buildings more distinctly
presented themselves. The harbour is large, and the vessels are
entirely mercantile, with a plentiful sprinkling of fishing smacks:
but the manner in which the latter harmonized with the tint and
structure of the houses--the bustle upon shore--the casks, deal
planks, ropes, and goods of every description upon the quays,--all
formed a most animated and interesting scene. The population seemed
countless, and chiefly females; whose high caps and enormous
ear-rings, with the rest of their paraphernalia, half persuaded me
that instead of being some few twenty-five leagues only from our
own white cliffs, I had in fact dropt upon the Antipodes! What a
scene (said I to my companion) for our CALCOTT to depict!<A name=
"fnref_20"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_20">20</A> It was a full
hour before we landed--saluted, and even assailed on all sides,
with entreaties to come to certain hotels. We were not long however
in fixing our residence at the <EM>Hotel d&#39;Angleterre,</EM> of
which the worthy Mons. De La Rue<A name="fnref_21"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_21">21</A> is the landlord.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER II.</H3>

<P>DIEPPE. FISHERIES. STREETS. CHURCHES OF ST. JAQUES AND ST. REMY.
DIVINE WORSHIP. MILITARY MASS.</P>

<P>The town of Dieppe contains a population of about
twenty-thousand souls.<A name="fnref_22"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_22">22</A> Of these, by much the greater <EM>stationary</EM>
part are females; arising from one third at least of the males
being constantly engaged in the FISHERIES. As these fisheries are
the main support of the inhabitants, it is right that you should
know something about them. The <EM>herring</EM> fishery takes place
twice a year: in August and October. The August fishery is carried
on along the shores of England and the North. From sixty to eighty
vessels, of from twenty-five to thirty tons burthen each, with
about fifteen men in each vessel, are usually employed. They are
freighted with salt and empty barrels, for seasoning and stowing
the fish, and they return about the end of October. The herrings
caught in August are considerably preferable to those caught in
October. The October fishery is carried on with smaller vessels,
along the coast of France from Boulogne to Havre. From one hundred
and twenty, to one hundred and thirty vessels, are engaged in this
latter navigation; and the fish, which is smaller, and of inferior
flavour to that caught upon the English coasts, is sent almost
entirely to the provinces and to Paris, where it is eaten fresh. So
much for the herring.<A name="fnref_23"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_23">23</A></P>

<P>The <EM>Mackarel</EM> fishery usually commences towards the
month of July, along the coast of Picardy; because, being a sort of
fish of passage, it gets into the channel in the month of April. It
then moves towards the straits of Dover, as summer approaches. For
this fishery they make use of large decked-vessels, from twenty to
fifty tons burthen, manned with from twelve to twenty men. There
are however Dieppe boats employed in this fishery which go as far
as the Scilly Islands and Ushant, towards the middle of April. They
carry with them the salt requisite to season the fish, which are
afterwards sent to Paris, and to the provinces in the interior of
France. The <EM>cod fishery</EM> is divided into the fresh and
dried fish. The former continues from the beginning of February to
the end of April--and the vessels employed, which go as far as
Newfoundland, are two deckers, and from one hundred to one hundred
and fifty tons burthen-- although, in fact, they rarely carry more
than fifteen tons for fear of spoiling the fish. The dried-cod
fishery is carried on in vessels of all sizes; but it is essential
that they be of a certain depth, because the fish is more
cumbersome than weighty. The vessels however usually set sail about
the month of March or April, in order that they may have the
advantage of the summer season, to dry the fish. There are vessels
which go to Newfoundland laden with brandy, flour, beans, treacle,
linen and woollen cloths, which they dispose of to the inhabitants
of the French colonies in exchange for dried cod. This latter
species of commerce may be carried on in the summer months--as late
as July.</P>

<P>In the common markets for retail trade, they are not very nice
in the quality or condition of their fish; and enormous conger
eels, which would be instantly rejected by the middling, or even
lower classes in England, are, at Dieppe, bought with avidity and
relished with glee. A few francs will procure a dish of fish large
enough for a dozen people. The quays are constantly crowded, but
there seems to be more of bustle than of business. The town is
certainly picturesque, notwithstanding the houses are very little
more than a century old, and the streets are formal and
comparatively wide. Indeed it should seem that the houses were
built expressly for Noblemen and Gentlemen, although they are
inhabited by tradesmen, mechanics, and artizans, in apparently very
indifferent circumstances. I scarcely saw six private houses which
could be called elegant, and not a gentleman&#39;s carriage has
been yet noticed in the streets. But if the <EM>Dieppois</EM> are
not rich, they seem happy, and are in a constant state of
occupation. A woman sells her wares in an open shop, or in an
insulated booth, and sits without her bonnet (as indeed do all the
tradesmen&#39;s wives), and works or sings as humour sways her. A
man sells gingerbread in an open shed, and in the intervals of his
customer&#39;s coming, reads some popular history or romance. Most
of the upper windows are wholly destitute of glass; but are
smothered with clothes, rags, and wall flowers. The fragrance
emitted from these flowers affords no unpleasing antidote to odors
of a very different description; and here we begin to have a too
convincing proof of the general character of the country in regard
to the want of cleanliness. A little good sense, or rather a
better-regulated police, would speedily get rid of such nuisances.
The want of public sewers is another great and grievous cause of
smells of every description. At Dieppe there are fountains in
abundance; and if some of the limpid streams, which issue from
them, were directed to cleansing the streets, (which are
excellently well paved) the effect would be both more salubrious
and pleasant--especially to the sensitive organs of Englishmen.</P>

<P>We had hardly concluded our breakfasts, when a loud and
clattering sound was heard; and down came, in a heavy trot, with
sundry ear-piercing crackings of the whip, the thundering
<EM>Diligence</EM>: large, lofty, and of most unwieldy dimensions:
of a structure, too, strong enough to carry a half score of
elephants. The postilion is an animal perfectly <EM>sui
generis</EM>: gay, alert, and living upon the best possible terms
with himself. He wears the royal livery, red and blue; with a plate
of the fleur de lis upon his left arm. His hair is tied behind, in
a thick, short, tightly fastened queue: with powder and pomatum
enough to weather a whole winter&#39;s storm and tempest.<A name=
"fnref_24"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_24">24</A> As he never
rises in his stirrups,<A name="fnref_25"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_25">25</A> I leave you to judge of the merciless effects of
this ever-beating club upon the texture of his jacket. He is
however fond of his horses: is well known by them; and there is all
flourish and noise, and no sort of cruelty, in his treatment of
them. His spurs are of tremendous dimensions; such as we see
sticking to the heels of knights in illuminated Mss. of the XVth
century. He has nothing to do with the ponderous machine behind
him. He sits upon the near of the two wheel horses, with three
horses before him. His turnings are all adroitly and correctly
made; and, upon the whole, he is a clever fellow in the exercise of
his office.</P>

<P>You ought to know, that, formerly, this town was greatly
celebrated for its manufactures in <EM>Ivory</EM>; but the present
aspect of the ivory-market affords only a faint notion of what it
might have been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I
purchased a few subordinate articles (chiefly of a religious
character) and which I shall preserve rather as a matter of
evidence than of admiration. There is yet however a considerable
manufacture of <EM>thread lace</EM>; and between three and four
thousand females are supposed to earn a comfortable livelihood by
it.<A name="fnref_26"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_26">26</A></P>

<P>My love of ecclesiastical architecture quickly induced me to
visit the CHURCHES; and I set out with two English gentlemen to pay
our respects to the principal church, St. JAQUES. As we entered it,
a general gloom prevailed, and a sort of premature evening came on;
while the clatter of the sabots was sufficiently audible along the
aisles. In making the circuit of the side chapels, an unusual light
proceeded from a sort of grated door way. We approached, and
witnessed a sight which could not fail to rivet our attention. In
what seemed to be an excavated interior, were several figures, cut
in stone, and coloured after life, (of which they were the size)
representing the <EM>Three Maries, St. John, and Joseph of
Arimathea</EM>.. in the act of entombing Christ: the figure of our
Saviour being half sunk into the tomb. The whole was partially
illuminated by some two dozen of shabby and nearly consumed tallow
candles; affording a striking contrast to the increasing darkness
of the nave and the side aisles. We retired, more and more struck
with the novelty of every object around us, to our supper and beds,
which were excellent; and a good night&#39;s rest made me forget
the miseries of the preceding evening.</P>

<P>The next morning, being Sunday, we betook ourselves in good time
to the service of ST. JAQUES:<A name="fnref_27"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_27">27</A> but on our way thither, we saw a waxen
figure of Christ (usually called an &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;) enclosed
within a box, of which the doors were opened. The figure and box
are the property of the man who plays on a violin, close to the
box; and who is selling little mass books, supposed to be rendered
more sacred by having been passed across the feet and hands of the
waxen Christ. Such a mongrel occupation, and such a motley group,
must strike you with astonishment--as a Sunday morning&#39;s
recreation.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/061.png" alt="Scene"></DIV>

<P>By half past ten the congregation had assembled within the
Church; and every side-chapel (I think about twelve in number)
began to be filled by the penitent flocks: each bringing, or
hiring, a rush-bottomed chair--with which the churches are pretty
liberally furnished, and of which the <EM>Tarif</EM> (or terms of
hire) is pasted upon the walls. There were, I am quite sure, full
eighteen women to one man: which may in part be accounted for, by
the almost uniform absence of a third of the male population
occupied in the fisheries. I think there could not have been fewer
than two thousand souls present. But what struck me as the most
ludicrously solemn thing I had ever beheld, was a huge tall figure,
dressed like a drum-major, with a large cocked hat and three white
plumes, (the only covered male figure in the congregation,) a broad
white sash upon a complete suit of red, including red
stockings;--representing what in our country is called a
<EM>Beadle</EM>. He was a sturdy, grim-looking fellow; bearing an
halberd in his right hand, which he wielded with a sort of pompous
swing, infusing terror into the young, and commanding the
admiration of the old. I must not, however, omit to inform you,
that half the service was scarcely performed when the preacher
mounted a pulpit, with a black cap on, and read a short sermon from
a printed book. I shall long have a distinct recollection of the
figure and attitude of the <EM>Verger</EM> who attended the
preacher. He followed him to the pulpit, fastened the door, became
stationary, and rested his left arm over the railings of the
stairs. Anon, he took out his snuff-box with his right hand, and
regaled himself with a pinch of snuff in the most joyous and
comfortably-abstracted manner imaginable. There he remained till
the conclusion of the discourse; not one word of which seemed to
afford him half the satisfaction as did the contents of his
snuff-box.</P>

<P><EM>Military Mass</EM> was performed about an hour after, at the
church of ST. REMY, whither I strolled quietly, to witness the
devotion of the congregation previous to the entry of the soldiers;
and I will not dissemble being much struck and gratified by what I
saw. There was more simplicity: a smaller congregation: softer
music: a lower-toned organ; less rush of people; and in very many
of the flock the most intense and unfeigned expression of piety. At
the elevation of the host, from the end of the choir, (near which
was suspended a white flag with the portrait of the present King<A
name="fnref_28"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_28">28</A> upon it)
a bell was rung from the tower of the church; the sound, below, was
soft and silver-toned--accompanied by rather a quick movement on
the organ, upon the diapason stop; which, united with the silence
and prostration of the congregation, might have commanded the
reverence of the most profane.</P>

<P>There is nothing, my dear friend, more gratifying, in a foreign
land, than the general appearance of earnestness of devotion on a
sabbath day; especially within the HOUSE OF GOD. However, I quickly
heard the clangor of the trumpet, the beat of drums, the measured
tramp of human feet, and up marched two or three troops of the
national guard to perform military mass. I retired precipitately to
the Inn, being well pleased to have escaped this strange and
distracting sight: so little in harmony with the rites and
ceremonies of our own church, and in truth so little accordant with
the service which I had just beheld.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER III.</H3>

<P>VILLAGE AND CASTLE OF ARQUES. SABBATH AMUSEMENTS. MANNERS AND
CUSTOMS. BOULEVARDS.</P>

<P>As I had received especial injunctions from our friend P--- not
to leave Dieppe without paying a visit to the famous <EM>Chateau
d&#39; Arques</EM><A name="fnref_29"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_29">29</A>, in its neighbourhood, I resolved to seize the
opportunity of a tolerably fair, or rather gray-looking day, to go
and pay due homage to those venerable remains of antiquity. The
road thither is completely rural: apple-trees, just beginning to
burst their blossoms; hamlets, small farm- houses: a profusion of
rich herbage of various kinds--delighted and regaled me as I
pursued my tranquil walk. The country is of a gently-undulating
character; but the flats or meadows, between the parallel ranges of
hills, are subject to constant inundation from the sea; and in an
agricultural point of view are consequently of little use, except
for summer grazing of the cattle.</P>

<P>It was drawing on to vespers as I approached the <EM>Village of
Arques</EM>. The old castle had frequently peeped out upon me, in
my way thither, from its elevated situation; but being resolved to
see &quot;all that could be seen,&quot; a French village, for the
first time, was not to be overlooked. For a country church, I know
of few finer ones than that of Arques.<A name="fnref_30"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_30">30</A></P>

<P>The site of the castle is admirable. My approach was to the
western extremity; which, as you look down, brings the village and
church of Arques in the back ground. If the eye were to be
considered as a correct judge, this venerable pile, composed of
hard flint-stone, intermixed with brick, would perhaps claim
precedence, on the score of antiquity, over most of the castles of
the middle ages. A deep moat, now dry pasture land, with a bold
acclivity before you, should seem to bid defiance, even in times of
old, to the foot and the spear of the invader. There are circular
towers at the extremities, and a square citadel or donjon within.
To the north, a good deal of earth has been recently thrown against
the bases of the wall. The day harmonised admirably with the
venerable object before me. The sunshine lasted but for a minute:
when afterwards a gloom prevailed, and not a single catch of
radiant light gilded any portion of the building. All was quiet,
and of a sombre aspect,--and what <EM>you</EM>, in your admiration
of art, would call in perfectly &quot;fine keeping.&quot;</P>

<P>I descended the hill, bidding a long adieu to this venerable
relic of the hardihood of other times, and quickened my pace
towards Dieppe. In gaining upon the town, I began to discern groups
of rustics, as well as of bourgeoises, assembling and mingling in
the dance. The women never think of wearing bonnets, and you have
little idea how picturesquely the red and blue<A name=
"fnref_31"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_31">31</A> (the colours
of Raffaelle&#39;s Madonnas) glanced backwards and forwards amidst
the fruit trees, to the sound of the spirit-stirring violin. The
high, stiff, starched cauchoise, with its broad flappers, gave the
finishing stroke to the novelty and singularity of the scene; and
to their credit be it spoken, the women were much more tidily
dressed than the men. The couples are frequently female, for want
of a sufficient number of swains; but, whether correctly or
incorrectly paired, they dance with earnestness, if not with grace.
It was a picture à la Teniers, without its occasional grossness.
This then, said I to myself, is what I have so often heard of the
sabbath-gambols of the French--and long may they enjoy them! They
are surely better than the brutal orgies of the pot-house, or the
fanatical ravings of the tabernacle.<A name="fnref_32"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_32">32</A></P>

<P>A late plain dinner, with my favourite vin ordinaire, recruited
my strength, and kept me in perfectly good humour with Dieppe.</P>

<P>The deportment of the <EM>Dieppois</EM><A name="fnref_33"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_33">33</A> towards the English, is, upon
the whole, rather gracious than otherwise; because the town profits
by the liberality and love of expense of the latter. Yet the young
ones, as soon as they can lisp, are put in training for pronouncing
the <EM>G---- d----</EM> ; and a few horribly-deformed and
importunate beggars are for ever assailing the doors of the hotels.
But beggary is nothing like so frightful an evil as I had
anticipated. The general aspect of the town seems to indicate the
poverty of the inhabitants; their houses being too large to be
entirely occupied. Bonaparte appears to have been anxious about the
strengthening of the harbour; the navigation into which is somewhat
difficult and intricate. The sides of the walls, as you enter, are
lofty, steep, and strong; and raised batteries would render any
hostile approach extremely hazardous to the assailants.</P>

<P>There is no ship-building at this moment going on: the ribs of
about half a dozen, half rotted, small merchant-craft, being all
that is discernible. But much is projected, and much is hoped from
such projects. Dieppe has questionless many local advantages both
by land and by sea; yet it will require a long course of years to
infuse confidence and beget a love of enterprise. In spite of all
the <EM>naval zeal</EM>, it is here exhibited chiefly as affording
means of subsistence from the fisheries. I must not however
conclude my Dieppe journal without telling you that I hunted far
and near for a good bookseller and for some old books--but found
nothing worth the search, except a well-printed early <EM>Rouen
Missal</EM>, and <EM>Terence</EM> by <EM>Badius Ascensius</EM>. The
booksellers are supplied with books chiefly from Rouen; the local
press being too insignificant to mention.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER IV.</H3>

<P>ROUEN. APPROACH. BOULEVARDS. POPULATION. STREET SCENERY.</P>

<P>Here I am, my excellent good friend, in the most extraordinary
city in the world. One rubs one&#39;s eyes, and fancies one is
dreaming, upon being carried through the streets of this
old-fashioned place: or that, by some secret talismanic touch, we
are absolutely mingling with human beings, and objects of art, at
the commencement of the sixteenth century: so very curious, and out
of the common appearance of things, is almost every object
connected with ROUEN. But before I commence my observations upon
the <EM>town</EM>, I must give you a brief sketch of my
<EM>journey</EM> hither. We had bespoke our places in the cabriolet
of the Diligence, which just holds three tolerably comfortable;
provided there be a disposition to accommodate each other. This
cabriolet, as you have been often told, is a sort of a buggy, or
phaeton seat, with a covering of leather in the front of the coach.
It is fortified with a stiff leathern apron, upon the top of which
is a piece of iron, covered with the leather, to fasten firmly by
means of a hook on the perpendicular supporter of the head. There
are stiffish leathern curtains on each side, to be drawn, if
necessary, as a protection against the rain, &amp;c. You lean upon
the bar, or top of this leathern apron, which is no very
uncomfortable resting-place. And thus we took leave of Dieppe, on
the 4th day after our arrival there. As we were seated in the
cabriolet, we could hardly refrain from loud laughter at the
novelty of our situation, and the grotesqueness of the conveyance.
Our Postilion was a rare specimen of his species, and a perfectly
<EM>unique copy</EM>. He fancied himself, I suppose, rather getting
&quot;into the vale of years,&quot; and had contrived to tinge his
cheeks with a plentiful portion of rouge.<A name="fnref_34"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_34">34</A> His platted and powdered hair
was surmounted with a battered black hat, tricked off with faded
ribband: his jacket was dark blue velvet, with the insignia of his
order (the royal arms) upon his left arm. What struck me as not a
little singular, was, that his countenance was no very faint
resemblance of that of <EM>Voltaire</EM>, when he might have been
verging towards his sixtieth year. Most assuredly he resembled him
in his elongated chin, and the sarcastic expression of his mouth.
We rolled merrily along--the horses sometimes spreading, and
sometimes closing, according to the size of the streets through
which we were compelled to pass. The reins and harness are of
<EM>cord</EM>; which, however keep together pretty well. The
postilion endeavours to break the rapidity of the descent by
conducting the wheels over small piles of gravel or rubbish, which
are laid at the sides of the road, near the ditch; so that, to
those sitting in the cabriolet, and overlooking the whole process,
the effect, with weak nerves, is absolutely terrific. They stop
little in changing horses, and the Diligence is certainly well
managed, and in general no accidents occur.</P>

<P>The road from Dieppe to Rouen is wide, hard, and in excellent
condition. There are few or no hedges, but rows of apple-trees
afford a sufficient line of demarkation. The country is open, and
gently undulating; with scarcely any glimpses of what is called
forest-scenery, till you get towards the conclusion of the first
stage. Nothing particularly strikes you till you approach
<EM>Malaunai</EM>, within about half a dozen miles of Rouen, and of
course after the last change of horses. The environs of this
beautiful village repay you for every species of disappointment, if
any should have been experienced. The rising banks of a brisk
serpentine trout stream are studded with white houses, in which are
cotton manufactories that appear to be carried on with spirit and
success. Above these houses are hanging woods; and though the early
spring would scarcely have coated the branches with green in our
own country, yet <EM>here</EM> there was a general freshness of
verdure, intermingled with the ruddy blossom of the apple;
altogether rejoicing the eye and delighting the heart. Occasionally
there were delicious spots, which the taste and wealth of an
Englishman would have embellished to every possible degree of
advantage. But wealth, for the gratification of picturesque taste,
is a superfluity that will not quickly fall to the lot of the
French. The Revolution seems to have drained their purses, as well
as daunted their love of enterprise. Along the road- side there
were some few houses of entertainment; and we observed the emptied
cabriolet and stationary voiture, by the side of the gardens, where
Monsieur and Madame, with their families, tripped lightly along the
vistas, and tittered as John Bull saluted them. Moving vehicles,
and numerous riding and walking groups, increased upon us; and
every thing announced that we were approaching a <EM>great and
populous city</EM>.</P>

<P>The approach to ROUEN is indeed magnificent. I speak of the
immediate approach; after you reach the top of a considerable rise,
and are stopped by the barriers. You then look down a strait,
broad, and strongly paved road, lined with a double row of trees on
each side. As the foliage was not thickly set, we could discern,
through the delicately-clothed branches, the tapering spire of the
CATHEDRAL, and the more picturesque tower of the ABBAYE ST.
OUEN--with hanging gardens, and white houses, to the left--
covering a richly cultivated ridge of hills, which sink as it were
into the <EM>Boulevards</EM>, and which is called the <EM>Faubourg
Cauchoise</EM>. To the right, through the trees, you see the river
SEINE (here of no despicable depth or breadth) covered with boats
and vessels in motion: the voice of commerce, and the stir of
industry, cheering and animating you as you approach the town. I
was told that almost every vessel which I saw (some of them of two
hundred, and even of three hundred tons burthen) was filled with
brandy and wine. The lamps are suspended from the centre of long
ropes, across the road; and the whole scene is of a truly novel and
imposing character. But how shall I convey to you an idea of what I
experienced, as, turning to the left, and leaving the broader
streets which flank the quay, I began to enter the
<EM>penetralia</EM> of this truly antiquated town? What narrow
streets, what overhanging houses, what bizarre, capricious
ornaments! What a mixture of modern with ancient art! What
fragments, or rather ruins, of old delicately-built Gothic
churches! What signs of former and of modern devastation! What
fountains, gutters, groups of never-ceasing men, women, and
children, all gay, all occupied, and all apparently happy! The
<EM>Rue de la Grosse Horloge</EM> (so called from a huge, clumsy,
antiquated clock which goes across it) struck me as being not among
the least singular streets of Rouen. In five minutes I was within
the court-yard of the <EM>Hôtel Vatel</EM>, the favourite residence
of the English.</P>

<P>It was evening when I arrived, in company with three Englishmen.
We were soon saluted by the <EM>laquais de place</EM>--the
leech-like hangers-on of every hotel--who begged to know if we
would walk upon the Boulevards. We consented; turned to the right;
and, gradually rising, gained a considerable eminence. Again we
turned to the right, walking upon a raised promenade; while the
blossoms of the pear and apple trees, within a hundred walled
gardens, perfumed the air with a delicious fragrance. As we
continued our route along the <EM>Boulevard Beauvoisine</EM>, we
gained one of the most interesting and commanding views imaginable
of the city of Rouen--just at that moment lighted up by the golden
rays of a glorious sun- set--which gave a breadth and a mellower
tone to the shadows upon the Cathedral and the Abbey of St. Ouen.
The situation of Rouen renders it necessarily picturesque, view it
from what spot you will.</P>

<P>The population of Rouen is supposed to be full one hundred
thousand souls. In truth, there is no end to the succession of
human beings. They swarm like bees, and like bees are busy in
bringing home the produce of their industry. You have all the
bustle and agitation of Cheapside and Cornhill; only that the
ever-moving scene is carried on within limits one-half as broad.
Conceive Bucklersbury, Cannon-street, and Thames-street,--and yet
you cannot conceive the narrow streets of Rouen: filled with the
flaunting cauchoise, and echoing to the eternal tramp of the sabot.
There they are; men, women, and children--all abroad in the very
centre of the streets: alternately encountering the splashing of
the gutter, and the jostling of their townsmen--while the swift
cabriolet, or the slow-paced cart, or the thundering
<EM>Diligence</EM>, severs them, and scatters them abroad, only
that they may seem to be yet more condensely united. For myself, it
is with difficulty I believe that I am not living in the times of
our Henry VIII. and of their Francis I.; and am half disposed to
inquire after the residence of <EM>Guillaume Tailleur</EM> the
printer--the associate, or foreign agent of your favourite
<EM>Pynson</EM>.<A name="fnref_35"></A><A class="fnref" href=

<H3 class="letter">LETTER V.</H3>

<P>ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE. CATHEDRAL. MONUMENTS. RELIGIOUS
CEREMONIES. THE ABBEY OF ST. OUEN. THE CHURCHES OF ST. MACLOU, ST.
VINCENT, ST. VIVIEN, ST. GERVAIS, AND ST. PAUL.</P>

<P>I have now made myself pretty well acquainted with the geography
of Rouen. How shall I convey to you a summary, and yet a
satisfactory, description of it? It cannot be done. You love old
churches, old books, and relics of ancient art. These be my themes,
therefore: so fancy yourself either strolling leisurely with me,
arm in arm, in the streets--or sitting at my elbow. First for THE
CATHEDRAL:--for what traveller of taste does not doff his bonnet to
the <EM>Mother Church</EM> of the town through which he happens to
be travelling--or in which he takes up a temporary abode? The west-
front,<A name="fnref_36"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_36">36</A>
always the <EM>forte</EM> of the architect&#39;s skill, strikes you
as you go down, or come up, the principal street--<EM>La Rue des
Carmes</EM>,-- which seems to bisect the town into equal parts. A
small open space, (which however has been miserably encroached upon
by petty shops) called the <EM>Flower-garden</EM>, is before this
western front; so that it has some little breathing room in which
to expand its beauties to the wondering eyes of the beholder. In my
poor judgment, this western front has very few elevations
comparable with it<A name="fnref_37"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_37">37</A>--including even those of <EM>Lincoln</EM> and
<EM>York</EM>. The ornaments, especially upon the three porches,
between the two towers, are numerous, rich, and for the greater
part entire:--in spite of the Calvinists,<A name="fnref_38"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_38">38</A> the French revolution, and time.
Among the lower and smaller basso-relievos upon these porches, is
the subject of the daughter of Herodias dancing before Herod. She
is manoeuvering on her hands, her feet being upwards. To the right,
the decapitation of St. John is taking place.</P>

<P>The southern transept makes amends for the defects of the
northern. The space before it is devoted to a sort of vegetable
market: curious old houses encircle this space: and the ascent to
the door, but more especially the curiously sculptured porch
itself, with the open spaces in the upper part--light, fanciful and
striking to a degree--produce an effect as pleasing as it is
extraordinary. Add to this, the ever-restless feet of devotees,
going in and coming out--the worn pavement, and the frittered
ornaments, in consequence--seem to convince you that the ardour and
activity of devotion is almost equal to that of business.<A name=
"fnref_39"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_39">39</A></P>

<P>As you enter the cathedral, at the centre door, by descending
two steps, you are struck with the length and loftiness of the
nave, and with the lightness of the gallery which runs along the
upper part of it. Perhaps the nave is too narrow for its length.
The lantern of the central large tower is beautifully light and
striking. It is supported by four massive clustered pillars, about
forty feet in circumference;<A name="fnref_40"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_40">40</A> but on casting your eye downwards, you are
shocked at the tasteless division of the choir from the nave by
what is called a <EM>Grecian screen</EM>: and the interior of the
transepts has undergone a like preposterous restoration. The rose
windows of the transepts, and that at the west end of the nave,
merit your attention and commendation. I could not avoid noticing,
to the right, upon entrance, perhaps the oldest side chapel in the
cathedral: of a date, little less ancient than that of the northern
tower; and perhaps of the end of the twelfth century. It contains
by much the finest specimens of stained glass--of the early part of
the XVIth century. There is also some beautiful stained glass on
each side of the Chapel of the Virgin,<A name="fnref_41"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_41">41</A> behind the choir; but although
very ancient, it is the less interesting, as not being composed of
groups, or of historical subjects. Yet, in this, as in almost all
the churches which I have seen, frightful devastations have been
made among the stained-glass windows by the fury of the
Revolutionists.<A name="fnref_42"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_42">42</A></P>

<P>Respecting the MONUMENTS, you ought to know that the famous
ROLLO lies in one of the side-chapels, farther down to the right,
upon entering; although his monument cannot be older than the
thirteenth century. My attachment to the bibliomanical celebrity of
JOHN, DUKE OF BEDFORD, will naturally lead me to the notice of his
interment and monumental inscription. The latter is thus;</P>

<P>The Duke&#39;s tomb will be seen engraved in Sandford&#39;s

<P>There is a curious chapter in Pommeraye&#39;s <EM>Histoire de
l&#39;Eglise Cathedrale de Rouen</EM>, p. 203, respecting the
Duke&#39;s taking the habit of a canon of the cathedral. He
attended, with his first wife, ANNE OF BURGUNDY, and threw himself
upon the liberality and kindness of the monks, to be received by
them as one of their order: &quot;il les prioit d&#39;être receu
parmy eux comme un de leurs frères, et d&#39;avoir tous les jours
distribution de pain et de vin, et pour marque de fraternité
d&#39;être vétu du surplis et de l&#39;aumusse: comme aussi
d&#39;être associé, luy et sa très généreuse et très illustre
épouse, aux suffrages de leur compagnie, et à la participation de
tous les biens qu&#39;il plaira à Dieu leur donner la grace
d&#39;opérer,&quot; p. 204. A grand procession marked the day of
the Duke&#39;s admission into the monkish fraternity. The whole of
this, with an account of the Duke&#39;s superb presents to the
sacristy, his dining with his Duchess, and receiving their portion
of &quot;eight loaves and four gallons of wine,&quot; are
distinctly narrated by the minute Pommeraye.</P>

<P>As you approach the <EM>Chapel of the Virgin</EM>, you pass by
an ancient monument, to the left, of a recumbent Bishop, reposing
behind a thin pillar, within a pretty ornamented Gothic arch.<A
name="fnref_45"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_45">45</A> To the
eye of a tasteful antiquary this cannot fail to have its due
attraction. While however we are treading upon hallowed ground,
rendered if possible more sacred by the ashes of the illustrious
dead, let us move gently onwards towards the <EM>Chapel of the
Virgin</EM>, behind the choir. See, what bold and brilliant
monumental figures are yonder, to the right of the altar! How
gracefully they kneel and how devoutly they pray! They are the
figures of the CARDINALS D&#39;AMBOISE--uncle and nephew:--the
former, minister of Louis XII.<A name="fnref_46"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_46">46</A> and (what does not necessarily follow,
but what gives him as high a claim upon the gratitude of posterity)
the restorer and beautifier of the glorious building in which you
are contemplating his figure. This splendid monument is entirely of
black and white marble, of the early part of the sixteenth century.
The figures just mentioned are of white marble, kneeling upon
cushions, beneath a rich canopy of Gothic fretwork. They are in
their professional robes; their heads are bare, exhibiting the
tonsure, with the hair in one large curl behind. A small
whole-length figure of <EM>St. George</EM>, their tutelary saint,
is below them, in gilded marble: and the whole base, or lower
frieze, of the monument, is surrounded by six delicately sculptured
females, about three feet high, emblematic of the virtues for which
these cardinals were so eminently distinguished. These figures,
representing Faith, Charity, Prudence, Force, Justice, and
Temperance, are flanked by eight smaller ones, placed in carved
niches; while, above them, are the twelve Apostles, not less
beautifully executed.<A name="fnref_47"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_47">47</A></P>

<P>On gazing at this splendid monument of ancient piety and
liberality--and with one&#39;s mind deeply intent upon the
characters of the deceased--let us fancy we hear the sound of the
GREAT BELL from the south-west tower ... called the <EM>Amboise
Tower</EM> ... erected, both the bell and the tower, by the uncle
and minister AMBOISE. Know, my dear friend, that there was
<EM>once</EM> a bell, (and the largest in Europe, save one) which
used to send forth its sound, for three successive centuries, from
the said tower. This bell was broken about thirty years ago, and
destroyed in the ravages of the immediately succeeding years.<A
name="fnref_48"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_48">48</A> The
south-west tower remains, and the upper part of the central tower,
with the whole of the lofty wooden spire:--the fruits of the
liberality of the excellent men of whom such honourable mention has
been made. Considering that this spire is very lofty, and composed
of wood, <EM>it is surprising that it has not been destroyed by
tempest, or by lightning</EM>.<A name="fnref_49"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_49">49</A> The taste of it is rather capricious
than beautiful.</P>

<P>I have not yet done with the monuments, or rather have only
commenced the account of them.<A name="fnref_50"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_50">50</A> Examine yonder recumbent figure, to
the left of the altar, opposite the splendid monument upon which I
have just been dilating. It is lying upon its back, with a ghastly
expression of countenance, representing the moment when the last
breath has escaped from the body. It is the figure of the Grand
SENESCHAL DE BREZE,<A name="fnref_51"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_51">51</A>--Governor of Rouen, and husband of the celebrated
DIANE DE POICTIERS--that thus claims our attention. This figure is
quite naked, lying upon its back, with the right hand placed on the
stomach, but in an action which indicates <EM>life</EM>-- and
therefore it is in bad taste, as far as truth is concerned; for the
head being fallen back, much shrunken, and with a ghastly
expression of countenance--indicating that some time has elapsed
since it breathed its last--the hand could not rest in this
position. The cenotaph is of black marble, disfigured by the names
of idle visitors who choose to leave such impertinent memorials
behind. The famous GOUJON is supposed to be the sculptor of the
figure, which is painfully clever, but it strikes me as being too
small. At any rate, the arms and body seem to be too strong and
fleshy for the shrunken and death-stricken expression of the
countenance. Above the Seneschal, thus prostrate and lifeless,
there is another and a very clever representation of him, on a
smaller scale, on horseback.</P>

<P>On each side of this figure (which has not escaped serious
injury) are two females in white marble; one representing the
VIRGIN, and the other DIANE DE POICTIERS:<A name="fnref_52"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_52">52</A> they are little more than half
the size of life. The whole is in the very best style of the
sculpture of the time of Francis I. These precious specimens of
art, as well as several other similar remains, were carried away
during the revolution, to a place of safety. The choir is spacious,
and well adapted to its purposes; but who does not grieve to see
the Archbishop&#39;s stall, once the most curious and costly, of
the Gothic order, and executed at the end of the XVth century,
transformed into a stately common-place canopy, supported by
columns of chestnut-wood carved in the Grecian style? The LIBRARY,
which used to terminate the north transept, is--not gone--but
transferred. A fanciful stair-case, with an appropriate
inscription,<A name="fnref_53"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_53">53</A> yet attest that it was formerly an appendage to
that part of the edifice.</P>

<P>Before I quit the subject of the cathedral, I must not fail to
tell you something relating to the rites performed therein. Let us
quit therefore the dead for the living. Of course we saw, here, a
repetition of the ceremonies observed at Dieppe; but previously to
the feast of the <EM>Ascension</EM> we were also present at the
confirmation of three hundred boys and three hundred girls, each
very neatly and appropriately dressed, in a sort of sabbath attire,
and each holding a lighted wax taper in the hand. The girls were
dressed in white, with white veils; and the rich lent veils to
those who had not the means of purchasing them. The cathedral,
especially about the choir, was crowded to excess. I hired a chair,
stood up, and gazed as earnestly as the rest. The interest excited
among the parents, and especially the mothers, was very striking.
&quot;Voila la petite-- qu&#39;elle a l&#39;air charmant!--le petit
ange!&quot;....A stir is made ... they rise ... and approach, in
the most measured order, the rails of the choir ... There they
deposit their tapers. The priests, very numerous, extinguish them
as dexterously as they can; and the whole cathedral is perfumed
with the mixed scent of the wax and frankincense. The boys, on
approaching the altar, and giving up their tapers, kneel down; then
shut their eyes, open their mouths; and the priests deposit the
consecrated wafer upon their tongues. The procession now took a
different direction. They all went into the nave, where a sermon
was preached to the young people, expressly upon the occasion, by a
Monsieur Quillebeuf, a canon of the cathedral, and a preacher of
considerable popularity. He had one of the most meagre and
forbidding physiognomies I ever beheld, and his beard was black and
unshaven. But he preached well; fluently, and even eloquently:
making a very singular, but not ungraceful, use of his left
arm--and displaying at times rather a happy familiarity of manner,
wholly exempt from vulgarity, and well suited to the capacities and
feelings of his youthful audience. His subject was &quot;belief in
Christ Jesus;&quot; on which he gave very excellent proofs and
evidences. His voice was thin, but clear, and distinctly heard.</P>

<P>And now, my dear Friend, if you are not tired with this détour
of the CATHEDRAL, suppose we take a promenade to the next most
important ecclesiastical edifice in the city of Rouen. What say you
therefore to a stroll to the ABBEY of ST. OUEN?
&quot;Willingly,&quot; methinks I hear you reply. To the abbey
therefore let us go.</P>

<P>Leaving the Cathedral, you pass a beautifully sculptured
fountain (of the early time of Francis I.) which stands at the
corner of a street, to the right; and which, from its central
situation, is visited the live-long day for the sake of its limpid
waters. Push on a little further; then, turning to the right, you
get into a sort of square, and observe the ABBEY--or rather the
<EM>west-front</EM> of it, full in face of you. You gaze, and are
first struck with its matchless window: call it rose, or marygold,
as you please. I think, for delicacy and richness of ornament, this
window is perfectly unrivalled. There is a play of line in the
mullions, which, considering their size and strength, may be
pronounced quite a master-piece of art. You approach, regretting
the neglected state of the lateral towers, and enter, through the
large and completely-opened centre doors, the nave of the Abbey. It
was towards sun-set when we made our first entrance. The evening
was beautiful; and the variegated tints of sun-beam, admitted
through the stained glass of the window, just noticed, were
perfectly enchanting. The window itself, as you look upwards, or
rather as you fix your eye upon the centre of it, from the remote
end of the Abbey, or the <EM>Lady&#39;s Chapel</EM>, was a perfect
blaze of dazzling light: and nave, choir, and side aisles, seemed
magically illumined ...</P>

<P class="poetry">Seemed all on fire--within, around;<BR>
 Deep sacristy and altar&#39;s pale;<BR>
 Shone every pillar foliage-bound....</P>

<P class="poetry"><EM>Lay of the Last Minstrel</EM>.</P>

<P>We declared instinctively that the ABBEY OF ST. OUEN could
hardly have a rival;--certainly not a superior.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/093.png" alt="Chapel"></DIV>

<P>As the evening came on, the gloom of almost every side chapel
and recess was rendered doubly impressive by the devotion of
numerous straggling supplicants; and invocations to the presiding
spirit of the place, reached the ears and touched the hearts of the
bystanders. The grand western entrance presents you with the most
perfect view of the choir--a magical circle, or rather
oval--flanked by lofty and clustered pillars, and free from the
surrounding obstruction of screens, &amp;c. Nothing more airy and
more captivating of the kind can be imagined. The finish and
delicacy of these pillars are quite surprising. Above, below,
around--every thing is in the purest style of the XIVth and XVth
centuries. The central tower is a tower of beauty as well as of
strength. Yet in regard to further details, connected with the
interior, it must be admitted that there is very little more which
is deserving of particular description; except it be <EM>the
gallery</EM>, which runs within the walls of the nave and choir,
and which is considerably more light and elegant than that of the
cathedral. A great deal has been said about the circular windows at
the end of the south transept, and they are undoubtedly elegant:
but compared with the one at the extremity of the nave, they are
rather to be noticed from the tale attached to them, than from
their positive beauty. The tale, my friend, is briefly this. These
windows were finished (as well as the larger one at the west front)
about the year 1439. One of them was executed by the master- mason,
the other by his apprentice; and on being criticised by competent
judges, the performance of the <EM>latter</EM> was said to eclipse
that of the former. In consequence, the master became jealous and
revengeful, and actually poniarded his apprentice. He was of course
tried, condemned, and executed; but an existing monument to his
memory attests the humanity of the monks in giving him Christian
interment.<A name="fnref_54"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_54">54</A> On the whole, it is the absence of all obtrusive
and unappropriate ornament which gives to the interior of this
building that light, unencumbered, and faery-like effect which so
peculiarly belongs to it, and which creates a sensation that I
never remember to have felt within any other similar edifice.</P>

<P>Let me however put in a word for the <EM>Organ</EM>. It is
immense, and perhaps larger than that belonging to the Cathedral.
The tin pipes (like those of the organ in the Cathedral) are of
their natural colour. I paced the pavement beneath, and think that
this organ cannot be short of forty English feet in length. Indeed,
in all the churches which I have yet seen, the organs strike me as
being of magnificent dimensions.</P>

<P>You should be informed however that the extreme length of the
interior, from the further end of the Chapel of the Virgin, to its
opposite western extremity, is about four hundred and fifty English
feet; while the height, from the pavement to the roof of the nave,
or the choir, is one hundred and eight English feet. The transepts
are about one hundred and forty feet in length. The central tower,
upon the whole, is not only the grandest tower in Rouen, but there
is nothing for its size in our own country that can compare with
it. It rises upwards of one hundred feet above the roof of the
church; and is supported below, or rather within, by four
magnificent cluster-pillared bases, each about thirty-two feet in
circumference. Its area, at bottom, can hardly be less than
thirty-six feet square. The choir is flanked by flying buttresses,
which have a double tier of small arches, altogether
&quot;marvellous and curious to behold.&quot;</P>

<P>I could not resist stealing quietly round to the porch of the
<EM>south transept</EM>, and witnessing, in that porch, one of the
most chaste, light, and lovely specimens of Gothic architecture,
which can be contemplated. Indeed, I hardly know any thing like
it.<A name="fnref_55"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_55">55</A> The
leaves of the poplar and ash were beginning to mantle the exterior;
and, seen through their green and gay lattice work, the traceries
of the porch seemed to assume a more interesting aspect. They are
now mending the upper part of the façade with new stone of peculiar
excellence--but it does not harmonise with the old work. They merit
our thanks, however, for the preservation of what remains of this
precious pile. I should remark to you that the eastern and north-
eastern sides of the abbey of St. Ouen are surrounded with
promenades and trees: so that, occasionally, either when walking,
or sitting upon the benches, within these gardens, you catch one of
the finest views imaginable of the abbey.</P>

<P>At this early season of the year, much company is assembled
every evening in these walks: while, in front of the abbey, or in
the square facing the western end, the national guard is exercised
in the day time--and troops of fair nymphs and willing youths
mingle in the dance on a sabbath evening, while a platform is
erected for the instrumental performers, and for the exhibition of
feats of legerdemain. You must not take leave of St. Ouen without
being told that, formerly, the French Kings used occasionally to
&quot;make revel&quot; within the Abbot&#39;s house. Henry II,
Charles IX, and Henry III, each took a fancy to this spot--but
especially the famous HENRI QUATRE. It is reported that that
monarch sojourned here for four months--- and his reply to the
address of the aldermen and sheriff of Rouen is yet preserved both
in MS. and by engravings. &quot;The King having arrived at St. Ouen
(says an old MS.)<A name="fnref_56"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_56">56</A> the keys of the tower were presented to him, in the
presence of M. de Montpensier, the governor of the province, upon a
velvet- cushion. The keys were gilt. The King took them, and
replacing them in the hands of the governor, said--&quot;Mon
cousin, je vous les baille pour les rendre, qu&#39;ils les
gardent;&quot;--then, addressing the aldermen, he added,
&quot;Soyez moi bons sujets et je vous serai bon Roi, et le
meilleur Roi que vous ayez jamais eu.&quot;</P>

<P>Next to the Abbey of St. Ouen, &quot;go by all means and see the
church <EM>St. Maclou</EM>&quot;--say your friends and your guides.
The Abbé Turquier accompanied me thither. The great beauties of St.
Maclou are its tower and its porch. Of the tower, little more than
the lantern remains. This is about 160 English feet in height.
Above it was a belfry or steeple, another 110 feet in height,
constructed of wood and lead--but which has been nearly destroyed
for the sake of the lead,--for the purpose of slaughter or
resistance during the late revolution.<A name="fnref_57"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_57">57</A> The exteriors of the porches are
remarkable for their elaborate ornaments; especially those in the
<EM>Rue Martainville.</EM> They are highly praised by the
inhabitants, and are supposed to be after the models of the famous
Goujon. Perhaps they are rather encumbered with ornament, and want
that quiet effect, and pure good taste, which we see in the porches
of the Cathedral and of the Abbey St. Ouen. However, let critics
determine as they will upon this point--they must at least unite in
reprobating the barbarous edict which doomed these delicate pieces
of sculptured art to be deluged with an over-whelming tint of
staring yellow ochre!</P>

<P>Of the remaining churches, I shall mention only four: two of
them chiefly remarkable for their interior, and two for their
extreme antiquity. Of the two former, that of <EM>St. Vincent</EM>
presents you with a noble organ, with a light choir profusely
gilded, and (rarer accompaniment!) in very excellent taste. But the
stained glass is the chief magnet of attraction. It is rich,
varied, and vivid to a degree; and, upon the whole, is the finest
specimen of this species of art in the present ecclesiastical
remains of the city. <EM>St. Vivien</EM> is the second of these two
former. It is a fine open church, with a large organ, having a very
curious wooden screen in front, elaborately carved, and, as I
conceive, of the very earliest part of the sixteenth century. I
ascended the organ-loft; and the door happening to be open, I
examined this screen (which has luckily escaped the yellow-ochre
edict) very minutely, and was much gratified by the examination.
Such pieces of art, so situated, are of rare occurrence. For the
first time, within a parish church, I stepped upon the pavement of
the choir: walked gently forwards, to the echo of my own footsteps,
(for not a creature was in the church) and, &quot;with no
unhallowed hand&quot; I would hope, ventured to open the choral or
service book, resting upon its stand. It was wide, thick, and
ponderous: upon vellum: beautifully written and well executed in
every respect, with the exception of the illuminations which were
extremely indifferent. I ought to tell you that the doors of the
churches, abroad, are open at all times of the day: the ancient or
more massive door, or portal, is secured from shutting; but a
temporary, small, shabby wooden door, covered with dirty green
baize, opening and shutting upon circular hinges, just covers the
vacuum left by the absence of the larger one.</P>

<P>Of the two ancient churches, above alluded to, that of <EM>St.
Gervais</EM>, is situated considerably to the north of where the
<EM>Boulevards Cauchoise</EM> and <EM>Bouvreuil</EM> meet. It was
hard by this favourite spot, say the Norman historians, that the
ancient Dukes of Normandy built their country-houses: considering
it as a <EM>lieu de plaisance.</EM> Here too it was that the
Conqueror came to breathe his last--desiring to be conveyed
thither, from his palace in the city, for the benefit of the pure
air.<A name="fnref_58"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_58">58</A> I
walked with M. Le Prevost to this curious church: having before
twice seen it. But the <EM>Crypt</EM> is the only thing worth
talking about, on the score of antiquity. The same accomplished
guide bade me remark the extraordinary formation of the capitals of
the pillars: which, admitting some perversity of taste in a rude,
Norman, imitative artist, are decidedly of Roman character.
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said M. Le Prevost, &quot;the last efforts of
Roman art previous to the relinquishment of the Romans.&quot; Among
these capitals there is one of the perfect Doric order; while in
another you discover the remains of two Roman eagles. The columns
are all of the same height; and totally unlike every thing of the
kind which I have seen or heard of.</P>

<P>We descended the hill upon which <EM>St. Gervais</EM> is built,
and walked onward towards <EM>St. Paul</EM>, situated at the
further and opposite end of the town, upon a gentle eminence, just
above the Banks of the Seine.<A name="fnref_59"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_59">59</A> M. Le Prevost was still our conductor.
This small edifice is certainly of remote antiquity, but I suspect
it to be completely Norman. The eastern end is full of antiquarian
curiosities. We observed something like a Roman mask as the centre
ornament upon the capital of one of the circular figures; and Mr.
Lewis made a few slight drawings of one of the grotesque heads in
the exterior, of which the hair is of an uncommon fashion. The
<EM>Saxon whiskers</EM> are discoverable upon several of these
faces. Upon the whole, it is possible that parts of this church may
have been built at the latter end of the tenth century, after the
Normans had made themselves completely masters of this part of the
kingdom; yet it is more probable that there is no vestige left
which claims a more ancient date than that of the end of the
eleventh century. I ought just to notice the church of <EM>St.
Sever</EM>,<A name="fnref_60"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_60">60</A> supposed by some to be yet more ancient: but I had
no opportunity of taking a particular survey of it.</P>

<P>Thus much, or rather thus little, respecting the ECCLESIASTICAL
ANTIQUITIES of Rouen. They merit indeed a volume of themselves.
This city could once boast of upwards of <EM>thirty parish
churches</EM>; of which very nearly a <EM>dozen</EM> have been
recently (I mean during the Revolution) converted into
<EM>warehouses</EM>. It forms a curious, and yet melancholy
mélange-- this strange misappropriation of what was formerly held
most sacred, to the common and lowest purposes of civil life! You
enter these warehouses, or offices of business, and see the broken
shaft, the battered capital, and half-demolished altar-piece--the
gilded or the painted frieze--in the midst of bales of
goods--casks, ropes, and bags of cotton: while, without, the same
spirit of demolition prevails in the fractured column, and
tottering arch way. Thus time brings its changes and
decays--premature as well as natural: and the noise of the car-men
and injunctions of the clerk are now heard, where formerly there
reigned a general silence, interrupted only by the matin or evening
chaunt! I deplored this sort of sacrilegious adaptation, to a
respectable-looking old gentleman, sitting out of doors upon a
chair, and smoking his pipe--&quot;c&#39;est dommage, Monsieur,
qu&#39;on a converti l&#39;église à&quot;--He stopped me: raised
his left hand: then took away his pipe with his right; gave a
gentle whiff, and shrugging up his shoulders, half archly and half
drily exclaimed--&quot;Mais que voulez vous, Monsieur?--ce sont des
événemens qu&#39;on ne peut ni prévoir ni prévenir. Voilà ce que
c&#39;est!&quot; Leaving you to moralize upon this comfortable
morceau of philosophy, consider me ever, &amp;c.</P>

<P>HALLES DE COMMERCE. PLACE DE LA PUCELLE D&#39;ORLEANS (JEANNE
D&#39;ARC.) BASSO- RILIEVO OF THE CHAMP DE DRAP D&#39;OR. PALACE
AND COURTS OF JUSTICE.</P>

<P>You must make up your mind to see a few more sights in the city
of Rouen, before I conduct you to the environs, or to the summit of
<EM>Mont St. Catherine</EM>. We must visit some relics of
antiquity, and take a yet more familiar survey of the town, ere we
strive</P>

<P class="poetry">... superas evadere ad auras.</P>

<P>Indeed the information to be gained well merits the toil endured
in its acquisition. The only town in England that can give you any
notion of Rouen, is CHESTER; although the similitude holds only in
some few particulars. I must, in the first place then, make
especial mention of the HALLES DE COMMERCE. The <EM>markets</EM>
here are numerous and abundant, and are of all kinds. Cloth,
cotton, lace, linen, fish, fruit, vegetables, meat, corn, and wine;
these for the exterior and interior of the body. Cattle, wood,
iron, earthenware, seeds, and implements of agriculture; these for
the supply of other necessities considered equally important. Each
market has its appropriate site. For picturesque effect, you must
visit the <EM>Vieux Marché</EM>, for vegetables and fish; which is
kept in an open space, once filled by the servants and troops of
the old Dukes of Normandy, having the ancient ducal palace in
front. This is the fountain head whence the minor markets are
supplied. Every stall has a large old tattered sort of umbrella
spread above it, to ward off the rain or rays of heat; and, seen
from some points of view, the effect of all this, with the
ever-restless motion of the tongues and feet of the vendors, united
to their strange attire, is exceedingly singular and
interesting.</P>

<P>Leaving the old market place, you pass on to the <EM>Marché
Neuf</EM>, where fruits, eggs, and butter are chiefly sold. At this
season of the year there is necessarily little or no fruit, but I
could have filled one coat pocket with eggs for less than half a
franc. While on the subject of buying and selling, let us go to the
<EM>Halles</EM> of <EM>Rouen</EM>; being large public buildings now
exclusively appropriated to the sale of cloths, linen, and the
varied <EM>et-ceteras</EM> of mercery. These are at once spacious
and interesting in a high degree. They form the divisions of the
open spaces, or squares, where the markets just mentioned are held;
and were formerly the appurtenances of the palaces and chateaux of
the old Dukes of Normandy: the <EM>latter</EM> of which are now
wholly demolished. You must rise betimes on a Friday morning, to
witness a sight of which you can have no conception in England:
unless it be at a similar scene in <EM>Leeds</EM>. By six
o&#39;clock the busy world is in motion within these halls. Then
commences the incessant and inconceivable vociferation of buying
and selling. The whole scene is alive, and carried on in several
large stone-arched rooms, supported by a row of pillars in the
centre. Of these halls, the largest is about three hundred and
twenty English feet in length, by fifty-five in width. The centre,
in each division, contains tables and counters for the display of
cloth, cotton, stuff, and linen of all descriptions. The display of
divers colours--the commendations bestowed by the seller, and the
reluctant assent of the purchaser--the animated eye of the former,
and the calculating brow of the latter--the removal of one set of
wares, and the bringing on of another--in short, the never-ceasing
succession of sounds and sights astonishes the gravity of an
Englishman; whose astonishment is yet heightened by the
extraordinary good humour which every where prevails. The laugh,
the joke, the équivoque, and reply, were worth being recorded in
pointed metre;--and what metre but that of Crabbe could possibly
render it justice? By nine of the clock all is hushed. The sale is
over: the goods are cleared; and both buyers and sellers have
quitted the scene.</P>

<P>From <EM>still</EM>, let me conduct you to <EM>active</EM> life.
In other words, let us hasten to take a peep at the <EM>Horse and
Cattle Market</EM>; which is fixed in the very opposite part of the
town; that is, towards the northern Boulevards. The horses are
generally entire: and indeed you have scarcely any thing in England
which exceeds the <EM>Norman horse</EM>, properly so understood.
This animal unites the hardiness of the mule with the strength of
his own particular species. He is also docile, and well trained;
and a Norman, from pure affection, thinks he can never put enough
harness upon his back. I have seen the face and shoulders of a
cart-horse almost buried beneath a profusion of ornament by way of
collar; and have beheld a farmer&#39;s horse, led out to the
plough, with trappings as gorgeous and striking as those of a
General&#39;s charger brought forward for a review. The carts and
vehicles are usually balanced in the centre upon two wheels, which
diminishes much of the pressure upon the horse. Yet the caps of the
wheels are frightfully long, and inconveniently projecting: while
the eternally loud cracking of the whip is most repulsive to
nervous ears. On market days, the horses stand pretty close to each
other for sale; and are led off, for shew, amidst boys, girls, and
women, who contrive very dexterously to get out of the way of their
active hoofs. The French seem to have an instinctive method of
doing that, which, with ourselves, seems to demand forethought and
deliberation.</P>

<P>Of the STREETS, in this extraordinary city, that of the
<EM>Great Clock-- (Rue de la Grosse Horloge)</EM> which runs in a
straight line from the western front of the Cathedral, at right
angles with the <EM>Rue des Carmes</EM>, is probably the most
important, ancient, and interesting. When we were conveyed, on our
entrance, (in the cabriolet of the Diligence) beneath the arch to
the upper part of which this old fashioned clock is attached, we
were lost in admiration at the singularity of the scene. The
inhabitants saw, and enjoyed, our astonishment. There is a fountain
beneath, or rather on one side of this arch; over which is
sculptured a motley group of insipid figures, of the latter time of
Louis XIV. The old tower near this clock merits a leisurely survey:
as do also some old houses, to the right, on looking at it. It was
within this old tower that a bell was formerly tolled, at nine
o&#39;clock each evening, to warn the inhabitants abroad to return
within the walls of the city.<A name="fnref_61"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_61">61</A></P>

<P>Turning to the left, in this street, and going down a sharp
descent, we observed a stand of hackney coaches in a small square,
called <EM>La Place de la Pucelle</EM>: that is, the place where
the famous JEANNE D&#39;ARC<A name="fnref_62"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_62">62</A> was imprisoned, and afterwards burnt. What
sensations possess us as we gaze on each surrounding
object!--although, now, each surrounding object has undergone a
palpable change! Ah, my friend--what emotions were <EM>once</EM>
excited within this small space! What curiosity, and even agony of
mind, mingled with the tumults of indignation, the shouts of
revenge, and the exclamations of pity! But life now goes on just
the same as if nothing of the kind had happened here. The past is
forgotten. This hapless Joan of Arc is one of the many, who, having
been tortured as heretics, have been afterwards reverenced as
martyrs. Her statue was, not very long after her execution, almost
<EM>adored</EM> upon that very spot where her body had been
consigned with execrations to the flames. The square, in which this
statue stands, contains probably one of the very oldest houses in
Rouen--and as interesting as it is ancient. It is invisible from
without: but you open a wooden gate, and quickly find yourself
within a small quadrangle, having three of its sides covered with
basso-rilievo figures in plaster. That side which faces you is
evidently older than the left: indeed I have no hesitation in
assigning it to the end of the XVth century. The clustered
ornaments of human figures and cattle, with which the whole of the
exterior is covered, reminds us precisely of those numerous little
wood-cut figures, chiefly pastoral, which we see in the borders of
printed missals of the same period. The taste which prevails in
them is half French and half Flemish. Not so is the character of
the plaster figures which cover the <EM>left</EM> side on entering.
These, my friend, are no less than the representation of the
procession of Henry VIII. and Francis I. to the famous CHAMP DE
DRAP D&#39;OR: of which Montfaucon<A name="fnref_63"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_63">63</A> has published engravings. Having
carefully examined this very curious relic, of the beginning of the
sixteenth century, I have no hesitation in pronouncing the copy of
Montfaucon (or rather of the artist employed by him) to be most
egregiously faithless. I visited it again and again, considering it
to be worth all the &quot;huge clocks&quot; in Rouen put together.
I hardly know how to take you from this interesting spot--from this
exhibition of beautiful old art--especially too when I consider
that Francis himself once occupied the mansion, and held a Council
here, with both English and French; that his bugles once sounded
from beneath the gate way, and that his goblets once sparkled upon
the chestnut tables of the great hall. I do hope and trust that the
Royal Academy of Rouen, will not suffer this architectural relic to
perish, without leaving behind a substantial and faithful
representation of it.<A name="fnref_64"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_64">64</A></P>

<P>While upon the subject of ancient edifices, let me return; and,
crossing the <EM>Rue de la Grosse Horloge</EM>, contrive to place
you in the centre of the square which is formed by the PALAIS DE
JUSTICE. The inhabitants consider this building as the principal
<EM>lion</EM> in their city. It has indeed claims to notice and
admiration, but will not bear the severe scrutiny of a critic in
Gothic architecture. It was partly erected by Louis XII. at the
entreaty of the provincial States, through the interest of the
famous Cardinal d&#39;Amboise, and partly by Francis I. This
building precisely marks the restoration of Gothic taste in France,
and the peculiar style of architecture which prevailed in the reign
of Francis I. To say the truth, this style, however sparkling and
imposing, is objectionable in many respects: for it is, in the
first place, neither pure Gothic nor pure Grecian--but an
injudicious mixture of both. Greek arabesque borders are running up
the sides of a portal terminating in a Gothic arch; and the Gothic
ornaments themselves are not in the purest, or the most pleasing,
taste. Too much is given to parts, and too little to the whole. The
external ornaments are frequently heavy, from their size and
elaborate execution; and they seem to be <EM>stuck on</EM> to the
main building without rhyme or reason.</P>

<P>The criminal offences are tried in the hall to the right, and
the prisoners are confined in the lower part of the building to the
left: above which you mount by a flight of stone steps, which
conducts you to a singularly curious hall,<A name="fnref_65"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_65">65</A> about one hundred and
seventy-five English feet in length--roofed by wooden ribs, in the
form of an arch, and displaying a most curious and exact specimen
of carpenter&#39;s work. This is justly shewn and commented upon to
the enquiring traveller. Parts of the building are devoted to the
courts of assize, and to tribunals of audience of almost every
description. The first Presidents of the Parliament lived formerly
in the building which faces you upon entrance, but matters have now
taken a very different turn. Upon the whole, this <EM>Town
Hall</EM>, or call it what you will, is rather a magnificent
structure; and certainly superior to most provincial buildings of
the kind which we possess in England. I should tell you that the
courts for commercial causes are situated near the quays, at the
south part of the town: and Monsieur Riaux, who conducted me
thither, (and who possesses the choicest library<A name=
"fnref_66"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_66">66</A> of antiquarian
books, of all descriptions, relating to Rouen, which I had the good
fortune to see) carried me to the <EM>Hall of Commerce</EM>, which,
among other apartments, contains a large chamber (contiguous to the
Court of Justice) covered with <EM>fleurs de lys</EM> upon a light
blue ground. It is now however much in need of reparation. Fresh
lilies and a new ground are absolutely necessary to harmonise with
a large oil-painting at one end of it, in which is represented the
reception of Louis XVI. at Rouen by the Mayor and Deputies of the
town, in 1786. All the figures are of the size of life, well
painted after the originals, and appear to be strong resemblances.
On enquiring how many of them were now living, I was told that--ALL
WERE DEAD! The fate of the <EM>principal</EM> figure is but too
well known. They should have this interesting subject--interesting
undoubtedly to the inhabitants--executed by one of their best
engravers. It represents the unfortunate Louis quite in the prime
of life; and is the best whole length portrait of him which I have
yet seen in painting or in engraving.</P>

<P>It is right however that you should know, that, in the Tribunal
for the determination of commercial causes, there sits a very
respectable Bench of Judges: among whom I recognised one that had
perfectly the figure, air, and countenance, of an Englishman. On
enquiry of my guide, I found my supposition verified. He
<EM>was</EM> an Englishman; but had been thirty years a resident in
<EM>Rouen</EM>. The judicial costume is appropriate in every
respect; but I could not help smiling, the other morning, upon
meeting my friend the judge, standing before the door of his house,
in the open street--with a hairy cap on--leisurely smoking his
pipe--And wherein consisted the harm of such a
<EM>delassement</EM>?</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER VII.</H3>

<P>THE QUAYS. BRIDGE OF BOATS. RUE DU BAC. RUE DE ROBEC. EAUX DE
ROBEC ET D&#39;AUBETTE. MONT STE. CATHARINE. HOSPICES--GÉNÉRAL ET
D&#39;HUMANITÉ.</P>

<P>Still tarrying within this old fashioned place? I have indeed
yet much to impart before I quit it, and which I have no scruple in
avowing will be well deserving of your attention.</P>

<P>Just letting you know, in few words, that I have visited the
famous chemical laboratory of M. Vitalis, (<EM>Rue
Beauvoisine</EM>) and the yet more wonderful spectacle exhibited in
M. Lemere&#39;s machine for sawing wood of all descriptions, into
small or large planks, by means of water works--I must take you
along THE QUAYS for a few minutes. These quays are flanked by an
architectural front, which, were it finished agreeably to the
original plan, would present us with one of the noblest structures
in Europe. This stone front was begun in the reign of Louis XV. but
many and prosperous must be the years of art, of commerce, and of
peace, before money sufficient can be raised for the successful
completion of the pile. The quays are long, broad, and full of
bustle of every description; while in some of the contiguous
squares, ponderous bales of goods, shawls, cloth, and linen, are
spread open to catch the observing eye. In the midst of this varied
and animated scene, walks a well-known character, in his large
cocked hat, and with his tin machine upon his back, filled with
lemonade or coffee, surmounted by a bell--which &quot;ever and
anon&quot; is sounded for the sake of attracting customers. He is
here copied to the life.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/118.png" alt="Well-known character"></DIV>

<P>As you pass along this animated scene, by the side of the rapid
Seine, and its <EM>Bridge of Boats</EM>, you cannot help glancing
now and then down the narrow old-fashioned streets, which run at
right angles with the quays- -with the innumerable small
tile-fashioned pieces of wood, like scales, upon the roofs--which
seem as if they would be demolished by every blast. The narrowness
and gloom of these streets, together with the bold and overwhelming
projections of the upper stories and roofs, afford a striking
contrast to the animated scene upon the quays:--where the sun
shines with full freedom, as it were; and where the glittering
streamers, at innumerable mast-heads, denote the wealth and
prosperity of the town. If the day happen to be fine, you may
devote half a morning in contemplating, and mingling with, so
interesting a scene.</P>

<P>We have had frequent thunder-storms of late; and the other
Sunday evening, happening to be sauntering at a considerable height
above the north-west Boulevards, towards the <EM>Faubourg
Cauchoise</EM>, I gained a summit, upon the edge of a gravel pit,
whence I looked down unexpectedly and precipitously upon the town
below. A magnificent and immense cloud was rolling over the whole
city. The Seine was however visible on the other side of it,
shining like a broad silver chord: while the barren, ascending
plains, through which the road to Caen passes, were gradually
becoming dusk with the overshadowing cloud, and drenched with rain
which seemed to be rushing down in one immense torrent. The tops of
the Cathedral and of the abbey of St. Ouen were almost veiled in
darkness, by the passing storm; but the lower part of the tower,
and the whole of the nave of each building, were in one stream of
golden light--from the last powerful rays of the setting sun. In
ten minutes this magically-varied scene settled into the sober,
uniform tint of evening; but I can never forget the rich bed of
purple and pink, fringed with burnished gold, in which the sun of
that evening set! I descended--absorbed in the recollection of the
lovely objects which I had just contemplated--and regaled by the
sounds of a thousand little gurgling streamlets, created by the
passing tempest, and hastening to precipitate themselves into the
Seine.</P>

<P>Of the different trades, especially retail, which are carried on
in Rouen with the greatest success, those connected with the
<EM>cotton manufactories</EM> cannot fail to claim your attention;
and I fancied I saw, in some of the shop-windows, shawls and gowns
which might presume to vie with our Manchester and Norwich
productions. Nevertheless, I learnt that the French were extremely
partial to British manufactures: and cotton stockings, coloured
muslins, and what are called ginghams, are coveted by them with the
same fondness as we prize their cambric and their lace. Their best
articles in watches, clocks, silver ornaments, and trinkets, are
obtained from Paris. But in respect to upholstery, I must do the
Rouennois the justice to say, that I never saw any thing to compare
with their <EM>escrutoires</EM> and other articles of furniture
made of the walnut tree. These upright escrutoires, or writing
desks, are in almost every bed-room of the more respectable hotels:
but of course their polish is gone when they become stationary
furniture in an inn--for the art of rubbing, or what is called
<EM>elbow-grease</EM> with us--is almost unknown on either side of
the Seine. You would be charmed to have a fine specimen of a side
board, or an escrutoire, (the latter five or six feet high) made by
one of their best cabinet-makers from choice walnut wood. The
polish and tone of colour are equally gratifying; and resemble
somewhat that of rose wood, but of a gayer aspect. The
<EM>or-molu</EM> ornaments are tastefully put on; but the general
shape, or contour, of the several pieces of furniture, struck me as
being in bad taste.</P>

<P>He who wishes to be astonished by the singularity of a scene,
connected with <EM>trade</EM>, should walk leisurely down the RUE
DE ROBEC. It is surely the oddest, and as some may think, the most
repulsive scene imaginable: But who that has a rational curiosity
could resist such a walk? Here live the <EM>dyers of
clothes</EM>--and in the middle of the street rushes the
precipitous stream, called <EM>L&#39;Eau de Robec</EM><A name=
"fnref_67"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_67">67</A>--receiving
colours of all hues. To-day it is nearly jet black: to-morrow it is
bright scarlet: a third day it is blue, and a fourth day it is
yellow! Meanwhile it is partially concealed by little bridges,
communicating with the manufactories, or with that side of the
street where the work-people live: and the whole has a dismal and
disagreeable aspect--especially in dirty weather: but if you go to
one end of it (I think to the east--as it runs east and west) and
look down upon the descending street, with the overhanging upper
stories and roofs--the foreshortened, numerous bridges-- the
differently-coloured dyed clothes, suspended from the windows, or
from poles--the constant motion of men, women, and children,
running across the bridges--with the rapid, <EM>camelion</EM>
stream beneath--you cannot fail to acknowledge that this is one of
the most singular, grotesque, and uncommon sights in the
wonder-working city of Rouen. I ought to tell you that the first
famous Cardinal d&#39;Amboise (of whom the preceding pages have
made such frequent honourable mention) caused the <EM>Eau de
Robec</EM> to be directed through the streets of Rouen, from its
original channel or source in a little valley near <EM>St. Martin
du Vivien</EM>. Formerly there was a much more numerous clan of
these &quot;teinturiers&quot; in the Rue de Robec--but they have of
late sought more capacious premises in the fauxbourgs <EM>de St.
Hilaire</EM> and <EM>de Martainville</EM>. The neighbouring
sister-stream, <EM>l&#39;Eau d&#39;Aubette</EM>, is destined to the
same purposes as that of which I have been just discoursing; but I
do not at this moment recollect whether it be also dignified, in
its course, by turning a few corn mills, ere it empties itself into
the Seine. Indeed the thundering noise of one of these mills,
turned by the Robec river, near the church of St. Maclou, will not
be easily forgotten. Thus you see of what various, strange, and
striking objects the city of Rouen is composed. Bustle, noise, life
and activity, in the midst of an atmosphere unsullied by the fumes
of sea coal:--hilarity and apparent contentment:--the spruce
bourgeoise and the slattern fille de chambre:--attired in vestments
of deep crimson and dark blue--every thing flits before you as if
touched by magic, and as if sorrow and misfortune were unknown to
the inhabitants.</P>

<P>&quot;Paullò majora canamus.&quot; In other words, let us leave
the Town for the Country. Let us hurry through a few more narrow
and crowded alleys, courts, and streets--and as the morning is yet
beautiful, let us hasten onwards to enjoy the famous Panorama of
Rouen and its environs from the MONT STE. CATHARINE.... Indeed, my
friend, I sincerely wish that you could have accompanied me to the
summit of this enchanting eminence: but as you are far away, you
must be content with a brief description of our little expedition
thither.<A name="fnref_68"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_68">68</A> The Mont Ste. Catharine, which is entirely chalk,
is considered the highest of the hills in the immediate vicinity of
Rouen; or rather, perhaps, is considered the point of elevation
from which the city is to be viewed to the greatest possible
advantage. It lies to the left of the Seine, in your way from the
town; and the ascent begins considerably beyond the barriers.
Indeed it is on the route to Paris. We took an excellent
<EM>fiacre</EM> to carry us to the beginning of the ascent, that
our legs might be in proper order for scrambling up the acclivities
immediately above; and leaving the main road to the right, we soon
commenced our ambulatory operations in good earnest. But there was
not much labour or much difficulty: so, halting, or standing, or
sitting, on each little eminence, our admiration seemed to
encrease--till, gaining the highest point, looking towards the
west, we found ourselves immediately above the town and the whole
of its environs....</P>

<P class="poetry">&quot;Heavens, what a goodly prospect spread
around!&quot;</P>

<P>The prospect was indeed &quot;goodly--&quot; being varied,
extensive, fertile, and luxuriant ... in spite of a comparatively
backward spring. The city was the main object, not only of
attraction, but of astonishment. Although the point from which we
viewed it is considered to be exactly on a level with the summit of
the spire of the Cathedral, yet we seemed to be hanging, as it
were, in the air, immediately over the streets themselves. We saw
each church, each public edifice, and almost each street; nay, we
began to think we could discover almost every individual stirring
in them. The soldiers, exercising on the parade in the Champ de
Mars, seemed to be scarcely two stones&#39; throw from us; while
the sounds of their music reached us in the most distinct and
gratifying manner. No &quot;Diable boiteux&quot; could ever have
transported a &quot;Don Cleophas Léandro Perez Zambullo&quot; to a
more favourable situation for a knowledge of what was passing in a
city; and if the houses had been unroofed, we could have almost
discerned whether the <EM>escrutoires</EM> were made of mahogany or
walnut-wood! This wonder- working effect proceeds from the
extraordinary clearness of the atmosphere, and the absence of
sea-coal fume. The sky was perfectly blue--the generality of the
roofs were also composed of blue slate: this, added to the
incipient verdure of the boulevards, and the darker hues of the
trunks of the trees, upon the surrounding hills--the lengthening
forests to the left, and the numerous white &quot;maisons de
plaisance&quot;<A name="fnref_69"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_69">69</A> to the right-- while the Seine, with its hundred
vessels, immediately below, to the left, and in face of you--with
its cultivated little islands--and the sweeping meadows or
race-ground<A name="fnref_70"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_70">70</A> on the other side--all, or indeed any, of these
objects could not fail to excite our warmest admiration, and to
make us instinctively exclaim &quot;that such a panorama was
perfectly unrivalled!&quot;</P>

<P>We descended Mont Ste. Catharine on the side facing the
<EM>Hospice Général</EM>: a building of a very handsome form, and
considerable dimensions. It is a noble establishment for
foundlings, and the aged and infirm of both sexes. I was told that
not fewer than twenty-five hundred human beings were sheltered in
this asylum; a number, which equally astonished and delighted me.
The descent, on this side the hill, is exceedingly pleasing; being
composed of serpentine little walks, through occasional alleys of
trees and shrubs, to the very base of the hill, not many hundred
yards from the hospital. The architecture of this extensive
building is more mixed than that of its neighbour the <EM>Hospice
d&#39;Humanité</EM>, on account of the different times in which
portions of it were added: but, upon the whole, you are rather
struck with its approach to what may be called magnificence of
style. I was indeed pleased with the good order and even good
breeding of its motley inhabitants. Some were strolling quietly,
with their arms behind them, between rows of trees:-- others were
tranquilly sitting upon benches: a third group would be in motion
within the squares of the building: a fourth appeared in deep
consultation whether the <EM>potage</EM> of to day were not
inferior to that of the preceding day?--&quot;Que cherchez vous,
Monsieur?&quot; said a fine looking old man, touching, and half
taking off, his cocked hat; &quot;I wish to see the Abbé
Turquier,&quot;--rejoined I. &quot;Ah, il vient de sortir--par ici,
Monsieur.&quot; &quot;Thank you.&quot; &quot;Monsieur je vous
souhaite le bon jour--au plaisir de vous revoir!&quot; And thus I
paced through the squares of this vast building. The
&quot;Portier&quot; had a countenance which our Wilkie would have
seized with avidity, and copied with inimitable spirit and
fidelity.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER VIII.</H3>

<P>EARLY TYPOGRAPHY AT ROUEN. MODERN PRINTERS. CHAP BOOKS.
BOOKSELLERS. BOOK COLLECTORS.</P>

<P>Now for a little gossip and chit-chat about <EM>Paper, Ink,
Books, Printing- Offices</EM>, and curiosities of a GRAPHIC
description. Perhaps the most regular method would be to speak of a
few of the principal <EM>Presses</EM>, before we take the
<EM>productions</EM> of these presses into consideration. And
first, as to the antiquity of printing in Rouen.<A name=
"fnref_71"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_71">71</A> The art of
printing is supposed to have been introduced here, by a citizen of
the name of MAUFER, between the years 1470 and 1480. Some of the
specimens of Rouen <EM>Missals</EM> and <EM>Breviaries</EM>,
especially of those by MORIN, who was the second printer in this
city, are very splendid. His device, which is not common, and
rather striking, is here enclosed for your gratification.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/129.png" alt="Device"></DIV>

<P>Few provincial towns have been more fertile in typographical
productions; and the reputation of TALLEUR, GUALTIER, and VALENTIN,
gave great respectability to the press of Rouen at the commencement
of the sixteenth century.</P>

<P>Yet I am not able to ascertain whether these presses were very
fruitful in <STRONG>Romances, Chronicles</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Old
Poetry</STRONG>. I rather think, however, that they were not
deficient in this popular class of literature, if I am to judge
from the specimens which are yet lingering, as it were, in the
hands of the curious. The gravity even of an archiepiscopal see
could never repress the natural love of the French, from time
immemorial, for light and fanciful reading.</P>

<P>You know with what pertinacity I grope about old alleys, old
courts, by- lanes, and unfrequented corners--in search of what is
curious, or precious, or rare in the book way. But ere we touch
that enchanting chord, let us proceed according to the plan laid
down. First therefore for printing- offices. Of these, the names of
PÉRIAUX, (<EM>Imprimeur de l&#39;Academie</EM>,) BAUDRY,
(<EM>Imprimeur du Roi</EM>) MÉGARD, (<EM>Rue Martainville</EM>) and
LECRENE-LABBEY, (<EM>Imprimeur-Libraire et Marchand de
Papiers</EM>) are masters of the principal presses; but such is the
influence of Paris, or of metropolitan fashions, that a publisher
will sometimes prefer getting his work printed at the capital.<A
name="fnref_72"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_72">72</A> Of the
foregoing printers, it behoves me to make some mention; and yet I
can speak personally but of two: Messieurs Périaux and Mégard. M.
Periaux is printer to the <EM>Académie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres
et Arts de Rouen</EM>, of which academy, indeed, he is himself an
accomplished member. He is quick, intelligent, well-bred, and
obliging to the last degree; and may be considered the <EM>Henry
Stephen</EM> of the Rouen Printers. He urged me to call often: but
I could visit him only twice. Each time I found him in his counting
house, with his cap on-- shading his eyes: a pen in his right hand,
and a proof sheet in his left. Though he rejoiced at seeing me, I
could discover (much to his praise) that, like Aldus, he wished me
to &quot;say my saying quickly,&quot;<A name="fnref_73"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_73">73</A> and to leave him to his
<EM>deles</EM> and <EM>stets</EM>! He has a great run of business,
and lives in one of those strange, old-fashioned houses, in the
form of a square, with an outside spiral staircase, so common in
this extraordinary city. He introduced me to his son, an
intelligent young man--well qualified to take the labouring oar,
either upon the temporary or permanent retirement of his parent.<A
name="fnref_74"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_74">74</A></P>

<P>Of Monsieur MÉGARD, who may be called the ancient
<EM>Jenson</EM>, or the modern <EM>Bulmer</EM>, of Rouen, I can
speak only in terms of praise--both as a civil gentleman and as a
successful printer. He is doubtless the most elegant printer in
this city; and being also a publisher, his business is very
considerable. He makes his regular half yearly journeys among the
neighbouring towns and villages, and as regularly brings home the
fruits of his enterprise and industry. On my first visit, M. Mégard
was from home; but Madame, &quot;son épouse, l&#39;attendoit à
chaque moment!&quot; There is a particular class of women among the
French, which may be said to be singularly distinguished for their
intelligence, civility, and good breeding. I mean the wives of the
more respectable tradesmen. Thus I found it, in addition to a
hundred similar previous instances, with Madame Mégard. &quot;Mais
Monsieur, je vous prie de vous asseoir. Que voulez vous?&quot;
&quot;I wish to have a little conversation with your husband. I am
an enthusiastic lover of the art of printing. I search every where
for skilful printers, and thus it is that I come to pay my respects
to Monsieur Mégard.&quot; We both sat down and conversed together;
and I found in Madame Mégard a communicative, and well-instructed,
representative of the said ancient Jenson, or modern Bulmer.
&quot;Enfin, voilà mon mari qui arrive&quot;--said Madame, turning
round, upon the opening of the door:--when I looked forward, and
observed a stout man, rather above the middle size, with a
countenance perfectly English--but accoutred in the dress of the
<EM>national guard</EM>, with a grenadier cap on his head. Madame
saw my embarrassment: laughed: and in two minutes her husband knew
the purport of my visit. He began by expressing his dislike of the
military garb: but admitted the absolute necessity of adopting such
a measure as that of embodying a national guard. &quot;Soyez le
bien venu; Ma foi, je ne suis que trop sensible, Monsieur, de
l&#39;honneur que vous me faites--vû que vous êtes antiquaire
typographique, et que vous avez publié des ouvrages relatifs à
notre art. Mais ce n&#39;est pas ici qu&#39;il faut en chercher de
belles épreuves. C&#39;est à Paris.&quot;</P>

<P>I parried this delicate thrust by observing that I was well
acquainted with the fine productions of <EM>Didot</EM>, and had
also seen the less aspiring ones of himself; of which indeed I had
reason to think his townsmen might be proud. This I spoke with the
utmost sincerity. My first visit concluded with two elegant little
book-presents, on the part of M. Megard--one being <EM>Heures de
Rouen, à l&#39;usage du Diocese</EM>, 1814, 12mo. and the other
<EM>Etrennes nouvelles commodes et utiles</EM>; 1815, 12mo.--the
former bound in green morocco; and the latter in calf, with gilt
leaves, but printed on a sort of apricot-tinted paper--producing no
unpleasing effect. Both are exceedingly well executed. My visits to
M. Mégard were rather frequent. He has a son at the Collége Royale,
or Lycée, whither I accompanied him, one Sunday morning, and took
the church of that establishment in the way. It is built entirely
in the Italian style of architecture: is exceedingly spacious: has
a fine organ, and is numerously attended. The pictures I saw in it,
although by no means of first-rate merit, quite convince me that it
is in churches of <EM>Roman</EM>, and not of <EM>Gothic</EM>
architecture, that paintings produce the most harmonious effect.
This college and church form a noble establishment, situated in one
of the most commanding eminences of the town. From some parts of
it, the flying buttresses of the nave of the Abbey of St. Ouen,
with the Seine at a short distance, surmounted by the hills and
woods of Canteleu as a back ground, are seen in the most gloriously
picturesque manner.</P>

<P>But the printer who does the most business--or rather whose
business lies in the lower department of the art, in bringing forth
what are called <EM>chap books</EM>--is
LECRENE-LABBEY--<EM>imprimeur-libraire et marchand de papiers</EM>.
The very title imports a sort of <EM>Dan Newberry&#39;s</EM>
repository. I believe however that Lecrêne-Labbey&#39;s business is
much diminished. He once lived in the <EM>Rue de la
Grosse-Horloge</EM>, No. 12: but at present carries on trade in one
of the out-skirting streets of the town. I was told that the
premises he now occupies were once an old church or monastery, and
that a thousand fluttering sheets are now suspended, where formerly
was seen the solemn procession of silken banners, with religious
emblems, emblazoned in colours of all hues. I called at the old
shop, and supplied myself with a dingy copy of the <EM>Catalogue de
la Bibliothéque Bleue</EM>--from which catalogue however I could
purchase but little; as the greater part of the old books, several
of the <EM>Caxtonian stamp</EM>, had taken their departures. It was
from this Catalogue that I learnt the precise character of the
works destined for common reading; and from hence inferred, what I
stated to you a little time ago, that <EM>Romances, Rondelays</EM>,
and chivalrous stories, are yet read with pleasure by the good
people of France. It is, in short, from this lower, or
<EM>lowest</EM> species of literature--if it must be so
designated--that we gather the real genius, or mental character of
the ordinary classes of society. I do assure you that some of these
<EM>chap</EM> publications are singularly droll and curious. Even
the very rudiments of learning, or the mere alphabet-book, meets
the eye in a very imposing manner--as in the following
facsimile.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/136.png" alt="Specimen"></DIV>

<P><EM>Love, Marriage</EM>, and <EM>Confession</EM>, are fertile
themes. in these little farthing chap books. Yonder sits a fille de
chambre, after her work is done. She is intent upon some little
manual, taken from the <EM>Bibliothèque Bleue</EM>. Approach her,
and ask her for a sight of it. She smiles, and readily shews you
<EM>Catéchisme à l&#39;usage des Grandes Filles pour être Mariées;
ensemble la manière d&#39;attirer les Amans</EM>. At the first
glance of it, you suppose that this is entirely, from beginning to
end, a wild and probably somewhat indecorous manual of instruction.
By no means; for read the <EM>Litanies</EM> and <EM>Prayer</EM>
with which it concludes, and which I here send; admitting that they
exhibit a strange mixture of the simple and the serious.</P>

<P>Among the books of this class, before alluded to, I purchased a
singularly amusing little manual called &quot;<EM>La Confession de
la Bonne Femme</EM>.&quot; It is really not divested of merit.
Whether however it may not have been written during the Revolution,
with a view to ridicule the practice of auricular confession which
yet obtains throughout France, I cannot take upon me to pronounce;
but there are undoubtedly some portions of it which seem so
obviously to satirise this practice, that one can hardly help
drawing a conclusion in the affirmative. On the other hand it may
perhaps be inferred, with greater probability, that it is intended
to shew with what extreme facility a system of
<EM>self-deception</EM> may be maintained.<A name="fnref_75"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_75">75</A> Referring however to the little
manual in question, among the various choice morceaus which it
contains, take the following extracts: exemplificatory of a
woman&#39;s <EM>evading the main points of confession</EM>.</P>

<P class="quote"><EM>Confesseur</EM>. Ne voulez vous pas me
répondre; en un mot, combien y a-t-il de temps que vous ne vous
êtes confessée?</P>

<P class="quote"><EM>La Pénitente.</EM> Il y a un mois tout juste,
car c&#39;étoit le quatrième jour du mois passé, &amp;nous sommes
au cinquième du mois courant; or comptez, mon pere, &amp;vous

<P class="quote">C. C&#39;est assez, ne parlez point tant,
&amp;dites moi en peu de mots vos péchés.</P>

<P class="quote"><EM>Elle raconte les péchés d&#39;autrui.</EM></P>

<P class="quote"><EM>La Pénitente</EM>. J&#39;ai un enfant qui est
le plus méchant garçon que vous ayez jamais vu: il jure, bat sa
soeur, il fuit l&#39;école, dérobe tout ce qu&#39;il peut pour
jouer; il suit de méchans fripons: l&#39;autre jour en courant il
perdit son chapeau. Enfin, c&#39;est un méchant garçon, je veux
vous l&#39;amener afin que vous me l&#39;endoctriniez un peu
s&#39;il vous plaît.</P>

<P class="quote">C. Dites-moi vos péchés.</P>

<P class="quote">P. Mais, mon père, j&#39;ai une fille qui est

c&#39;est un trop grand péché: J&#39;ai battu ma mère.</P>

<P class="quote">C. Vous avez battu votre mère! Ah! misérable,
c&#39;est un cas réservé &amp; un crime qui mérite la potence. Et

<P class="quote">C. Ah! simple, ne savez-vous pas que tout ce que

l&#39;âge de sept ans, ne sauroit être un péché.</P>

<P>There is however one thing, which I must frankly declare to you
as entitled to distinct notice and especial commendation. It is,
the method of teaching &quot;catechisms&quot; of a different and
higher order: I mean the CHURCH CATECHISMS. Both the Cathedral and
the Abbey of St. Ouen have numerous side chapels. Within these side
chapels are collected, on stated days of the week, the young of
both sexes. They are arranged in a circle. A priest, in his white
robes, is seated, or stands, in the centre of them. He examines,
questions, corrects, or commends, as the opportunity calls for it.
His manner is winning and persuasive. His action is admirable. The
lads shew him great respect, and are rarely rude, or seen to laugh.
Those who answer well, and pay the greater attention, receive, with
words of commendation, gentle pats upon the head--and I could not
but consider the blush, with which this mark of favour was usually
received, as so many presages of future excellence in the youth. I
once witnessed a most determined catechetical lecture of girls; who
might be called, in the language of their matrimonial catechism,
&quot;de grandes filles.&quot; It was on an evening, in the Chapel
of Our Lady in St. Ouen&#39;s Abbey, that this examination took
place. Two elderly priests attended. The responses of the females
were as quick as they were correct; the eye being always invariably
fixed on the pavement, accompanied with a gravity and even piety of
expression. A large group of mothers, with numerous spectators,
were in attendance. A question was put, to which a supposed
incorrect response was given. It was repeated, and the same answer
followed. The priest hesitated: something like vexation was
kindling in his cheek, while the utmost calmness and confidence
seemed to mark the countenance of the examinant. The attendant
mothers were struck with surprise. A silence for one minute ensued.
The question related to the &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; The priest
gently approached the girl, and softly articulated--&quot;Mais, ma
chère considerez un peu,&quot;--and repeated the question.
&quot;Mon pere, (yet more softly, rejoined the pupil) j&#39;ai bien
considerée, et je crois que c&#39;est comme je vous l&#39;ai déjà
dit.&quot; The Priest crossed his hands upon his breast ... brought
down his eyebrows in a thoughtful mood ... and turning quickly
round to the girl, addressed her in the most affectionate tone of
voice--&quot;Ma petite,--tu as bien dit; et j&#39;avois tort.&quot;
The conduct of the girl was admirable: She curtsied, blushed ...
and with eyes, from which tears seemed ready to start, surveyed the
circle of spectators ... caught the approving glance of her mother,
and sunk triumphantly upon her chair--with the united admiration of
teachers, companions, parents and spectators! The whole was
conducted with the most perfect propriety; and the pastors did not
withdraw till they were fairly exhausted. A love of truth obliges
me to confess that this reciprocity of zeal, on the part of master
and pupil, is equally creditable to both parties; and especially
serviceable to the cause of religion and morality.</P>

<P>Let me here make honourable mention of the kind offices of
<EM>Monsieur Longchamp</EM>, who volunteered his friendly services
in walking over half the town with me, to shew me what he justly
considered as the most worthy of observation. It is impossible for
a generous mind to refuse its testimony to the ever prompt kindness
of a well-bred Frenchman, in rendering you all the services in his
power. Enquire the way,--and you have not only a finger quickly
pointing to it, but the owner of the finger must also put himself
in motion to accompany you a short distance upon the route, and
that too uncovered! &quot;Mais, Monsieur, mettez votre chapeau ...
je vous en prie ... mille pardons.&quot; &quot;Monsieur ne dites
pas un seul mot ... pour mon chapeau, qu&#39;il reste à son
aise.&quot;</P>

<P>Among book-collectors, Antiquaries, and Men of Taste, let me
speak with becoming praise of the amiable and accomplished M.
AUGUSTE LE PREVOST--who is considered, by competent judges, to be
the best antiquary in Rouen.<A name="fnref_76"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_76">76</A> Mr. Dawson Turner, (a name, in our own
country, synonymous with all that is liberal and enlightened in
matters of virtù) was so obliging as to give me a letter of
introduction to him; and he shewed me several rare and splendid
works, which were deserving of the commendations that they received
from their owner.</P>

<P>M. Le Prevost very justly discredits any remains of Roman
masonry at Rouen; but he will not be displeased to see that the
only existing relics of the castle or town walls, have been copied
by the pencil of a late travelling friend. What you here behold is
probably of the fourteenth century.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:60%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/144.png" alt="Relics of the castle or town walls"></DIV>

<P>The next book-collector in commendation of whom I am bound to
speak, is MONSIEUR DUPUTEL; a member, as well as M. Le Prevost, of
the <EM>Academy of Belles-Lettres</EM> at Rouen. The Abbé Turquier
conducted me thither; and I found, in the owner of a choice
collection of books, a well-bred gentleman, and a most hearty
bibliomaniac. He has comparatively a small library; but, withal,
some very curious, scarce, and interesting volumes. M. Duputel is
smitten with that amiable passion,--the love of printing for
<EM>private distribution</EM>--thus meriting to become a sort of
Roxburghe Associate. He was so good as to beg my acceptance of the
&quot;nouvelle édition&quot; of his &quot;<EM>Bagatelles
Poétiques,&quot;</EM> printed in an octavo volume of about 112
pages, at Rouen, in 1816. On taking it home, I discovered the
following not infelicitous version of our Prior&#39;s beautiful
little Poem of <EM>the Garland</EM>.</P>

<P>The last and not the least of book-collectors, which I have had
an opportunity of visiting, is MONSIEUR RIAUX. With respect to what
may be called a ROUENNOISE LIBRARY, that of M. Riaux is greatly
preferable to any which I have seen; although I am not sure whether
M. Le Prevost&#39;s collection contain not nearly as many books. M.
Riaux is himself a man of first-rate book enthusiasm; and unites
the avocations of his business with the gratification of his
literary appetites, in a manner which does him infinite honour. A
city like Rouen should have a host of such inhabitants; and the
government, when it begins to breathe a little from recent
embarrassments, will, I hope, cherish and support that finest of
all patriotic feelings,--a desire to preserve the RELICS, MANNERS,
AND CUSTOMS of PAST AGES. Normandy is fertile beyond conception in
objects which may gratify the most unbounded passion in this
pursuit. It is the country where formerly the harp of the minstrel
poured forth some of its sweetest strains; and the lay and the
fabliaux of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which delight us
in the text of Sainte Palaye, and in the versions of Way, owed
their existence to the combined spirit of chivalry and literature,
which never slumbered upon the shores of Normandy.</P>

<P>Farewell now to ROUEN.<A name="fnref_77"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_77">77</A> I have told you all the tellings which I
thought worthy of communication. I have endeavoured to make you
saunter with me in the streets, in the cathedral, the abbey, and
the churches. We have, in imagination at least, strolled together
along the quays, visited the halls and public buildings, and gazed
with rapture from Mont Ste. Catharine upon the enchanting view of
the city, the river, and the neighbouring hills. We have from
thence breathed almost the pure air of heaven, and surveyed a
country equally beautified by art, and blessed by nature. Our
hearts, from that same height, have wished all manner of health,
wealth, and prosperity, to a land thus abounding in corn and wine,
and oil and gladness. We have silently, but sincerely prayed, that
swords may for ever be &quot;turned into plough-shares, and spears
into pruning-hooks:&quot;--that all heart-burnings, antipathies,
and animosities, may be eternally extinguished; and that, from
henceforth, there may be no national rivalries but such as tend to
establish, upon a firmer footing, and upon a more comprehensive
scale, the peace and happiness of fellow-creatures, of whatever
persuasion they may be:--of such, who sedulously cultivate the arts
of individual and of national improvement, and blend the duties of
social order with the higher calls of morality and religion. Ah! my
friend, these are neither foolish thoughts nor romantic wishes.
They arise naturally in an honest heart, which, seeing that all
creation is animated and upheld by ONE and the SAME POWER, cannot
but ardently hope that ALL may be equally benefited by a reliance
upon its goodness and bounty. From this eminence we have descended
somewhat into humbler walks. We have visited hospitals, strolled in
flower- gardens, and associated with publishers and collectors of
works--both of the dead and of the living. So now, fare you well.
Commend me to your family and to our common friends,--especially to
the Gorburghers should they perchance enquire after their wandering
Vice President. Many will be the days passed over, and many the
leagues traversed, ere I meet them again. Within twenty-four hours
my back will be more decidedly turned upon &quot;dear old
England&quot;--for that country, in which her ancient kings once
held dominion, and where every square mile (I had almost said
<EM>acre</EM>) is equally interesting to the antiquary and the
agriculturist. I salute you wholly, and am yours ever.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER IX.</H3>

<P>DEPARTURE FROM ROUEN. ST. GEORGE DE BOSCHERVILLE. DUCLAIR.
MARIVAUX. THE ABBEY OF JUMIEGES. ARRIVAL AT CAUDEBEC.</P>

<P><EM>May</EM>, 1818.</P>

<P>MY DEAR FRIEND.</P>

<P>In spite of all its grotesque beauties and antiquarian
attractions, the CITY OF ROUEN must be quitted--and I am about to
pursue my route more in the character of an independent traveller.
No more <EM>Diligence</EM>, or <EM>Conducteur</EM>. I have hired a
decent cabriolet, a decent pair of horses, and a yet more promising
postilion: and have already made a delightfully rural migration.
Adieu therefore to dark avenues, gloomy courts, overhanging roofs,
narrow streets, cracking whips, the never- ceasing noise of carts
and carriages, and never-ending movements of countless masses of
population:--Adieu!--and in their stead, welcome be the winding
road, the fertile meadow, the thickly-planted orchard, and the
broad and sweeping Seine!</P>

<P>Accordingly, on the 4th of this month, between the hours of ten
and eleven, A.M. the rattling of horses&#39; hoofs, and the echoes
of a postilion&#39;s whip, were heard within the court-yard of the
<EM>Hôtel Vatel</EM>. Monsieur, Madame, Jacques--and the whole
fraternity of domestics, were on the alert-- &quot;pour faire les
adieux à Messieurs les Anglois.&quot; This Jacques deserves
somewhat of a particular notice. He is the prime minister of the
Hôtel Vatel.<A name="fnref_78"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_78">78</A> A somewhat <EM>uncomfortable</EM> detention in
England for five years, in the character of &quot;prisoner of
war,&quot; has made him master of a pretty quick and ready
utterance of common-place phrases in our language; and he is not a
little proud of his attainments therein. Seriously speaking, I
consider him quite a phenomenon in his way; and it is right you
should know that he affords a very fair specimen of a sharp,
clever, French servant. His bodily movements are nearly as quick as
those of his tongue. He rises, as well as his brethren, by five in
the morning; and the testimonies of this early activity are quickly
discovered in the unceasing noise of beating coats, singing French
airs, and scolding the boot-boy. He rarely retires to rest before
mid-night; and the whole day long he is in one eternal round of
occupation. When he is bordering upon impertinence, he seems to be
conscious of it--declaring that &quot;the English make him saucy,
but that naturally he is very civil.&quot; He always speaks of
human beings in the <EM>neuter</EM> gender; and to a question
whether such a one has been at the Hotel, he replies, &quot;I have
not seen <EM>it</EM> to-day.&quot; I am persuaded he is a
thoroughly honest creature; and considering the pains which are
taken to spoil him, it is surprising with what good sense and
propriety he conducts himself.</P>

<P>About eleven o&#39;clock, we sprung forward, at a smart trot,
towards the barriers by which we had entered Rouen. Our postilion
was a thorough master of his calling, and his spurs and whip seemed
to know no cessation from action. The steeds, perfectly Norman,
were somewhat fiery; and we rattled along the streets, (for the
<EM>chaussé</EM> never causes the least abatement of pace with the
French driver) in high expectation of seeing a thousand rare sights
ere we reached Havre--equally the limits of our journey, and of our
contract with the owner of the cabriolet. That accomplished
antiquary M. Le Prevost, whose name you have often heard, had
furnished me with so dainty a bill of fare, or carte de voyage;
that I began to consider each hour lost which did not bring us in
contact with some architectural relic of antiquity, or some
elevated position--whence the wandering Seine and wooded heights of
the adjacent country might be surveyed with equal advantage.</P>

<P>You have often, I make no doubt, my dear friend, started upon
something like a similar expedition:--when the morning has been
fair, the sun bright, the breeze gentle, and the atmosphere clear.
In such moments how the ardour of hope takes possession of
one!--How the heart warms, and the conversation flows! The barriers
are approached; we turn to the left, and commence our journey in
good earnest. Previously to gaining the first considerable height,
you pass the village of <EM>Bapeaume</EM>. This village is
exceedingly picturesque. It is studded with water-mills, and is
enlivened by a rapid rivulet, which empties itself, in a serpentine
direction, into the Seine. You now begin to ascend a very
commanding eminence; at the top of which are scattered some of
those country houses which are seen from Mont Ste. Catharine. The
road is of a noble breadth. The day warmed; and dismounting, we let
our steeds breathe freely, as we continued to ascend leisurely. Our
first halting-place, according to the instructions of M. Le
Prevost, was <EM>St. George de Boscherville</EM>; an ancient abbey
established in the twelfth century, This abbey is situated about
three French leagues from Rouen. Our route thither, from the summit
of the hill which we had just ascended, lay along a road skirted by
interminable orchards now in full bloom. The air was perfumed to
excess by the fragrance of these blossoms. The apple and pear were
beautifully conspicuous; and as the sky became still more serene,
and the temperature yet more mild by the unobstructed sun beam, it
is impossible to conceive any thing more balmy and genial than was
this lovely day. The minutes seemed to fly away too quickly--when
we reached the village of <EM>Boscherville</EM>; where stands the
CHURCH; the chief remaining relic of this once beautiful abbey. We
surveyed the west front very leisurely, and thought it an extremely
beautiful specimen of the architecture of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries; for certainly there are some portions more
ancient than others. A survey of the chapter-house filled me with
mingled sorrow and delight: sorrow, that the Revolution and a
modern cotton manufactory had metamorphosed it from its original
character; and delight, that the portions which remained were of
such beautiful forms, and in such fine preservation. The stone,
being of a very close-grained quality, is absolutely as white and
sound as if it had been just cut from the quarry. The room, where a
parcel of bare-legged girls and boys were working the respective
machineries, had a roof of the most delicate construction.<A name=
"fnref_79"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_79">79</A></P>

<P>The very sound of a <EM>Monastery</EM> made me curious to
examine the disposition of the building. Accordingly, I followed my
guide through suites of apartments, up divers stone stair-cases,
and along sundry corridors. I noticed the dormitories with due
attention, and of course inquired eagerly for the LIBRARY:--but the
shelves only remained--either the fear or the fury of the
Revolution having long ago dispossessed it of every thing in the
shape of a <EM>book</EM>. The whole was painted white. I counted
eleven perpendicular divisions; and, from the small distances
between the upper shelves, there must have been a very considerable
number of <EM>duodecimos</EM>. The titles of the respective classes
of the library were painted in white letters upon a dark-blue
ground, at top. <EM>Bibles</EM> occupied the first division, and
the <EM>Fathers</EM> the second: but it should seem that equal
importance was attached to the works of <EM>Heretics</EM> as to
those called <EM>Litterae Humaniores</EM>--for each had a division
of equal magnitude.</P>

<P>On looking out of window, especially from the back part of the
building, the eye rests entirely upon what had once been fruitful
orchards, abundant kitchen gardens, and shady avenues. Yet in
England, this spot, rich by nature, and desirable from its
proximity to a great city, would, ere forty moons had waned, have
grown up into beauty and fertility, and expanded into luxuriance of
condition.</P>

<P>The day was now, if possible, more lovely than before. On
looking at my instructions I found that we had to stop to examine
the remains of an old castle at <EM>Delafontaine</EM>--about two
English miles from <EM>St. George de Boscherville</EM>. These
remains, however, are but the fragments of a ruin, if I may so
speak; yet they are interesting, but somewhat perilous: for a few
broken portions of a wall support an upper chamber, where appears a
stone chimney-piece of very curious construction and ornament. On
observing a large cavity or loop-hole, about half way up the outer
wall, I gained it by means of a plentiful growth of ivy, and from
thence surveyed the landscape before me. Here, having for some time
past lost sight of the Seine, I caught a fine bold view of the
sweep of that majestic river, now becoming broader and
broader--while, to the left, softly tinted by distance, appeared
the beautiful old church we had just quitted: the verdure of the
hedges, shrubs, and forest trees, affording a rich variety to the
ruddy blossoms of the apple, and the white bloom of the pear. I
admit, however, that this delicious morceau of landscape was
greatly indebted, for its enchanting effect, to the blue splendour
of the sky, and the soft temperature of the air; while the
fragrance of every distended blossom added much to the
gratification of the beholder. But it is time to descend from this
elevation; and to think of reaching Duclair.</P>

<P>DUCLAIR is situated close to the very borders of the Seine,
which has now an absolute lake-like appearance. We stopped at the
auberge to rest our horses; and I commenced a discourse with the
master of the inn and his daughter; the latter, a very
respectable-looking and well-behaved young woman of about
twenty-two years of age. She was preparing a large crackling
wood-fire to dress a fish called the <EM>Alose</EM>, for the
passengers of the <EM>diligence</EM>--who were expected within half
an hour. The French think they can never <EM>butter</EM> their
victuals sufficiently; and it would have produced a spasmodic
affection in a thoroughly bilious spectator, could he have seen the
enormous piece of butter which this active young
<EM>cuisinière</EM> thought necessary to put into the pot in which
the &#39;<EM>Alose</EM>&#39; was to be boiled. She laughed at the
surprise I expressed; and added &quot;qu&#39;on ne peut rien faire
dans la cuisine sans le beurre.&quot; You ought to know, by the by,
that the <EM>Alose</EM>, something like our <EM>mackerel</EM> in
flavour, is a large and delicious fish; and that we were always
anxious to bespeak it at the table-d&#39;hôte at Rouen. Extricated
from the lake of butter in which it floats, when brought upon
table, it forms not only a rich, but a very substantial dish.</P>

<P>I took a chair and sat in the open air, by the side of the
door-- enjoying the breeze, and much disposed to gossip with the
master of the place. Perceiving this, the landlord approached, and
addressed me with a pleasant degree of familiarity. &quot;You are
from London, then, Sir?&quot; &quot;I am.&quot; &quot;Ah Sir, I
never think of London but with the most painful sensations.&quot;
&quot;How so?&quot; &quot;Sir, I am the sole heir of a rich banker
who died in that city before the Revolution. He was in partnership
with an English gentleman. Can you possibly advise and assist me
upon the subject?&quot; I told him that my advice and assistance
were literally not worth a sous; but that, such as they were, he
was perfectly welcome to both. &quot;Your daughter Sir, is not
married?&quot;--&quot;Non, Monsieur, elle n&#39;est pas encore
épousée: mais je lui dis qu&#39;elle ne sera jamais
<EM>heureuse</EM> avant qu&#39;elle le soit.&quot; The daughter,
who had overheard the conversation, came forward, and looking
archly over her shoulder, replied--&quot;ou <EM>malheureuse</EM>,
mon père!&quot; A sort of truism, expressed by her with singular
epigrammatic force, to which there was no making any reply.</P>

<P>Do you remember, my dear friend; that exceedingly cold
winter&#39;s night, when, for lack of other book-entertainment, we
took it into our heads to have a rummage among the <EM>Scriptores
Historiae Normannorum</EM> of DUCHESNE?--and finding therein many
pages occupied by <EM>Gulielmus Gemeticensis</EM>, we bethought
ourselves that we would have recourse to the valuable folio volume
yeleped <EM>Neustria Pia</EM>:--where we presently seemed to hold
converse with the ancient founders and royal benefactors of certain
venerable establishments! I then little imagined that it would ever
fall to my lot to be either walking or musing within the precincts
of the Abbey of Jumieges;--or rather, of the ruins of what was once
not less distinguished, as a school of learning, than admired for
its wealth and celebrity as a monastic establishment. Yes, my
friend, I have seen and visited the ruins of this Abbey; and I seem
to live &quot;mihi carior&quot; in consequence.</P>

<P>But I know your love of method--and that you will be in wrath if
I skip from <EM>Duclair</EM> to JUMIEGES ere the horses have
carried us a quarter of a league upon the route. To the left of
<EM>Duclair</EM>, and also washed by the waters of the Seine,
stands <EM>Marivaux</EM>; a most picturesque and highly cultivated
spot. And across the Seine, a little lower down, is the beautiful
domain of <EM>La Mailleraye</EM>;--where are hanging gardens, and
jets d&#39;eaux, and flower-woven arbours, and daisy-sprinkled
meadows--for there lives and occasionally revels <EM>La
Marquise</EM>.... I might have been not only a spectator of her
splendor, but a participator of her hospitality; for my
often-mentioned valuable friend, M. Le Prevost, volunteered me a
letter of introduction to her. What was to be done? One cannot be
everywhere in one day, or in one journey:--so, gravely balancing
the ruins of still life against the attractions of animated
society, I was unchivalrous enough to prefer the former--and
working myself up into a sort of fantasy, of witnessing the
spectered forms of DAGOBERT and CLOVIS, (the fabled founders of the
Abbey) I resolutely turned my back upon <EM>La Mailleraye</EM>, and
as steadily looked forwards to JUMIEGES. We ascended very
sensibly--then striking into a sort of bye-road, were told that we
should quickly reach the place of our destination. A fractured
capital, and broken shaft, of the late Norman time, left at random
beneath a hedge, seemed to bespeak the vicinity of the abbey. We
then gained a height; whence, looking straight forward, we caught
the first glance of the spires, or rather of the west end towers,
of the Abbey of Jumieges.<A name="fnref_80"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_80">80</A> &quot;La voilà,
&quot;Monsieur,&quot;--exclaimed the postilion--increasing his
speed and multiplying the nourishes of his whip--&quot;voilà la
belle Abbaye!&quot;</P>

<P>We approached and entered the village of Jumieges. Leaving some
neat houses to the right and left, we drove to a snug auberge,
evidently a portion of some of the outer buildings, or of the
chapter-house, attached to the Abbey. A large gothic roof, and
central pillar, upon entering, attest the ancient character of the
place.<A name="fnref_81"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_81">81</A>
The whole struck us as having been formerly of very great
dimensions. It was a glorious sun-shiny afternoon, and the
villagers quickly crowded round the cabriolet. &quot;Voilà
Messieurs les Anglois, qui viennent voir l&#39;Abbaye--mais
effectivement il n&#39;y a rien à voir.&quot; I told the landlady
the object of our visit. She procured us a guide and a key: and
within five minutes we entered the nave of the abbey. I can never
forget that entrance. The interior, it is true, has not the magical
effect, or that sort of artificial burst, which attends the first
view of <EM>Tintern</EM> abbey: but, as the ruin is larger, there
is necessarily more to attract attention. Like Tintern also, it is
unroofed--yet this unroofing has proceeded from a different cause:
of which presently. The side aisles present you with a short
flattened arch: the nave has none: but you observe a long
pilaster-like, or alto-rilievo column, of slender dimensions,
running from bottom to top, with a sort of Roman capital. The
arched cieling and roof are entirely gone. We proceeded towards the
eastern extremity, and saw more frightful ravages both of time and
of accident. The latter however had triumphed over the former: but
for <EM>accident</EM> you must read <EM>revolution</EM>.</P>

<P>The day had been rather oppressive for a May morning; and we
were getting far into the afternoon, when clouds began to gather,
and the sun became occasionally obscured. We seated ourselves upon
a grassy hillock, and began to prepare for dinner. To the left of
us lay a huge pile of fragments of pillars and groinings of
arches--the effects of recent havoc: to the right, within three
yards, was the very spot in which the celebrated AGNES SOREL,
Mistress of Charles VII, lay entombed:<A name="fnref_82"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_82">82</A>--not a relic of mausoleum now
marking the place where, formerly, the sculptor had exhibited the
choicest efforts of his art, and the devotee had repaired to</P>

<P class="quote">Breathe a prayer for her soul--and pass on!</P>

<P>What a contrast to the present aspect of things!--to the mixed
rubbish and wild flowers with which every spot is now well nigh
covered! The mistress of the inn having furnished us with napkins
and tumblers, we partook of our dinner, surrounded by the objects
just described, with no ordinary sensations. The air now became
oppressive; when, looking through the few remaining unglazed
mullions of the windows, I observed that the clouds grew blacker
and blacker, while a faint rumbling of thunder reached our ears.
The sun however yet shone gaily, although partially; and as the
storm neared us, it floated as it were round the abbey,
affording--by means of its purple, dark colour, contrasted with the
pale tint of the walls,--one of the most beautiful painter-like
effects imaginable. In an instant almost--and as if touched by the
wand of a mighty necromancer--the whole scene became metamorphosed.
The thunder growled, but only growled; and the threatening phalanx
of sulphur-charged clouds rolled away, and melted into the quiet
uniform tint which usually precedes sun-set. Dinner being
dispatched, I rose to make a thorough examination of the ruins
which had survived ... not only the Revolution, but the cupidity of
the present owner of the soil--who is a <EM>rich</EM> man, living
at Rouen--and who loves to dispose of any portion of the stone,
whether standing or prostrate, for the sake of the lucre, however
trifling, which arises from the sale. Surely the whole corporation
of the city of Rouen, with the mayor at their head, ought to stand
between this ruthless, rich man, and the abbey--the victim of his
brutal avarice and want of taste.<A name="fnref_83"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_83">83</A></P>

<P>The situation of the abbey is delightful. It lies at the bottom
of some gently undulating hills, within two or three hundred yards
of the Seine. The river here runs gently, in a serpentine
direction, at the foot of wood- covered hills--and all seemed, from
our elevated station, indicative of fruitfulness, of gaiety, and of
prosperity,--all--save the mournful and magnificent remains of the
venerable abbey whereon we gazed! In fact, this abbey exists only
as a shell. I descended, strolled about the village, and mingled in
the conversation of the villagers. It was a lovely approach of
evening--and men, women, and children were seated, or sauntering,
in the open air. Perceiving that I was anxious to gain information,
they flocked around me-- and from one man, in particular, I
obtained exact intelligence about the havoc which had been
committed during the Revolution upon the abbey, The roof had been
battered down for the sake of the <EM>lead</EM>--to make bullets;
the pews, altars, and iron-work, had been converted into other
destructive purposes of warfare; and the great bell had been sold
to some speculators in a cannon-foundery at Rouen.<A name=
"fnref_84"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_84">84</A> The
revolutionary mania had even brutalized the Abbot. This man, who
must be considered as</P>

<P class="poetry">....damned to everlasting fame,</P>

<P>had been a monk of the monastery; and as soon as he had attained
the headship of it, he disposed of every movable piece of
furniture, to gratify the revolutionary pack which were daily
howling at the gates of the abbey for entrance! Nor could he plead
<EM>compulsion</EM> as an excuse. He seemed to enjoy the work of
destruction, of which he had the uncontrouled direction. But enough
of this wretch.</P>

<P>The next resting-place was CAUDEBEC: a very considerable
village, or rather a small town. You go down a steep descent, on
entering it by the route we came. As you look about, there are
singular appearances on all sides--of houses, and hanging gardens,
and elaborately cut avenues--upon summits, declivities, and on the
plain. But the charm of the view, at least to my old-fashioned
feelings, was a fine old gothic church, and a very fine spire of
what <EM>appeared</EM> to belong to another. As the evening had
completely set in, I resolved to reserve my admiration of the place
till the morrow.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER X.</H3>

<P>CAUDEBEC. LILLEBONNE. BOLBEC. TANKARVILLE. MONTMORENCI CASTLE.
HAVRE DE GRACE.</P>

<P>My last concluded with our entrance into Caudebec. The present
opens with a morning scene at the same place. For a miracle I was
stirring before nine. The church was the first object of
attraction. For the size of the place, it is really a noble
structure: perhaps of the early part of the sixteenth, or latter
part of the fifteenth century.<A name="fnref_85"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_85">85</A> I speak of the exterior generally, and
of a great portion of the interior. A little shabby green- baise
covered door (as usual) was half open, and I entered with no
ordinary expectations of gratification. The painted glass seemed
absolutely to warm the place--so rich and varied were its colours.
There is a great abundance of it, and especially of figures of
family-groups kneeling--rather small, but with great appearance of
portrait-like fidelity. They are chiefly of the first half of the
sixteenth century: and I own that, upon gazing at these charming
specimens of ancient painting upon glass, I longed to fix an artist
before every window, to bear away triumphantly, in a portfolio of
elephantine dimensions, a faithful copy of almost every thing I
saw. In some of the countenances, I fancied I traced the pencil of
LUCAS CRANACH-- and even of HANS HOLBEIN.</P>

<P>This church has numerous side chapels, and figures of
patron-saints. The entombment of Christ in white marble, (at the
end of the chapel of the Virgin,) is rather singular; inasmuch as
the figure of Christ itself is ancient, and exceedingly fine in
anatomical expression; but the usual surrounding figures are
modern, and proportionably clumsy and inexpressive. I noted one
mural monument, to the memory of <EM>Guillaume Tellier</EM>, which
was dated 1484.<A name="fnref_86"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_86">86</A> Few churches have more highly interested me than
this at Caudebec.<A name="fnref_87"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_87">87</A> From the church I strolled to the <EM>Place</EM>,
where stood the caffé, by the banks of the Seine. The morning view
of this scene perfectly delighted me. Nothing can be more
picturesque. The river cannot be much less than a mile in width,
and it makes a perfect bend in the form of a crescent. On one side,
that on which the village stands, are walks and gardens through
which peep numerous white villas--and on the other are meadows,
terminating in lofty rising grounds--feathered with coppice-wood
down to the very water&#39;s edge. This may be considered, in fact,
only a portion of the vast <EM>Forest de Brotonne</EM>, which rises
in wooded majesty on the opposite heights. The spirit and the
wealth of our countrymen would make Caudebec one of the most
enchanting summer-residences in the world. The population of the
town is estimated at about five thousand.</P>

<P>Judge of my astonishment, when, on going out of doors, I saw the
river in a state of extreme agitation: the whole mass of water
rising perpendicularly, as it were, and broad rippling waves
rolling over each other. It was the <EM>coming in of the
tide</EM>.... and within a quarter of an hour it appeared to have
risen upwards of three feet. You may remember that, in our own
country, the Severn-tides exhibit the same phenomenon; and I have
seen the river at Glocester rise <EM>at once</EM> to the height of
eight or ten feet, throwing up a shower of foam from the gradually
narrowing bed of the river, and causing all the craft, great and
small, to rise up as if by magic, and to appear upon a level with
the meadows. The tide at Caudebec, although similar in kind, was
not so in degree; for it rose gradually yet most visibly--and
within half an hour, the elevation could not have been less than
<EM>seven</EM> or <EM>eight</EM> feet.</P>

<P>Having walked for some time on the heights of the town, with
which I was much gratified, I returned to my humble auberge,
ordered the cabriolet to be got ready, and demanded the
reckoning:--which, considering that I was not quite at an
hôtel-royale, struck me as being far from moderate. Two old women,
of similar features and age, presented themselves as I was getting
into the carriage: one was the mistress, and the other the fille de
chambre. &quot;Mais, Monsieur (observed one of them) n&#39;oubliez
pas, je vous prie, la fille-de-chambre--rappellez-vous que vos
souliers ont été supérieurement décrottés.&quot; I took out a franc
to remunerate the supposed fille-de-chambre--but was told it was
the <EM>mistress</EM>. &quot;N&#39;importe, Monsieur, c&#39;est à
ce moment que je suis fille-de-chambre--quand vous serez parti, je
serai la maitresse.&quot; The postilion seemed to enjoy this
repartee as much as ourselves.</P>

<P>I was scarcely out of the town half a mile, when I began to
ascend. I found myself quickly in the middle of those rising
grounds which are seen from the promenade or <EM>Place du
Caffé</EM>, and could not look without extraordinary gratification
upon the beautiful character of spring in its advanced state. The
larch was even yet picturesque: the hazel and nut trees were
perfectly clothed with foliage, of a tender yet joyous tint: the
chestnut was gorgeously in bloom; the lime and beech were beginning
to give abundant promise of their future luxuriance--while the
lowlier tribes of laburnum and box, with their richly clad
branches, covered the ground beneath entirely from view. The apple
and pear blossoms still continued to variegate the wide sweep of
foliage, and to fill the air with their delicious perfume. It might
be Switzerland in miniature--or it might not. Only this I
know--that it seemed as though one could live embosomed and
enchanted in such a wilderness of sweets--reading the
<EM>fabliaux</EM> of the old Norman bards till the close of human
existence!</P>

<P>I found myself on a hard, strait, chalky old road--evidently
Roman: and in due time perceived and entered the town of
LILLEBONNE. But the sky had become overcast: soft and small rain
was descending, and an unusual gloom prevailed ... when I halted,
agreeably to my instructions, immediately before the gate of the
ancient <EM>Castle</EM>. Venerable indeed is this Norman castle,
and extensive are the ruins which have survived. I have a perfect
recollection how it peeped out upon me--through the light leaf of
the poplar, and the pink blossom of the apple. It lies close to the
road, on the left. An old round tower, apparently of the time of
William the Conqueror, very soon attracts your attention. The
stones are large, and the interstices are also very considerable.
It was here, says a yet current report, that William assembled the
Barons of Normandy, and the invasion of England was determined
upon. Such a spot therefore strikes an English beholder with no
ordinary emotions. I alighted; sent the cabriolet to the inn, and
wished both postilion and horses to get their dinners without
delay. For myself, I had resolved to reserve my appetite till I
reached <EM>Bolbec</EM>; and there was food enough before me of a
different description, to exercise my intellectual digestion for at
least the next hour. Knocking at the massive portals, I readily
obtained admittance.</P>

<P>The area, entirely a grass-plat, was occupied by several cows.
In front, were evidently the ruins of a large chapel or
church--perhaps of the XIVth century. The outer face of the walls
went deeply and perpendicularly down to the bottom of a dry fosse;
and the right angle portion of the building was covered with garden
ground, where the owner showed us some peas which he boasted he
should have at his table within five days. I own I thought he was
very likely to carry his boast into execution; for finer
vegetables, or a finer bed of earth, I had scarcely ever beheld.
How things, my dear friend, are changed from their original
character and destination! &quot;But the old round tower,&quot; say
you!--To &quot;the old round tower&quot; then let us go. The
stair-case is narrow, dark, and decayed. I reached the first floor,
or circular room, and noticed the construction of the window
seats--all of rough, solid, and massive stone. I ascended to the
second floor; which, if I remember rightly, was strewn with a
portion of the third floor--that had fallen in from sheer decay.
Great must have been the crash--as the fragments were huge, and
widely scattered. On gaining a firm footing upon the outer wall;
through a loop-hole window, I gazed around with equal wonder and
delight. The wall of this castle could not be less than ten feet in
thickness. A young woman, the shepherdess of the spot, attended as
guide.</P>

<P>&quot;What is that irregular rude mound, or wall of earth, in
the centre of which children are playing?&quot; &quot;It is the
<EM>old Roman Theatre</EM>, Sir.&quot; I immediately called to mind
M. Le Prevost&#39;s instructions--and if I could have borrowed the
wings of a spirit, I should have instantly alighted upon the
spot--but it was situated without the precincts of the old castle
and its appurtenances, and a mortal leap would have been attended
with a mortal result. &quot;Have you many English who visit this
spot?&quot; said I to my guide.-- &quot;Scarcely <EM>any</EM>,
Sir--it is a frightful place--full of desolation and
sadness..&quot; replied she. Again I gazed around, and in the
distance, through an aperture in the orchard trees, saw the little
fishing village of <EM>Quillebeuf</EM>,<A name="fnref_88"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_88">88</A> quite buried, as it were, in the
waters of the Seine. An arm of the river meanders towards
Lillebonne. Having gratified my picturesque and antiquarian
propensities, from this elevated situation, I retrod, with more
difficulty than toil, my steps down the stair-case. A second stroll
about the area, and along the skirts of the wall, was sufficient to
convince me only--how slight and imperfect had been my survey!</P>

<P>On quitting the portal through which I entered, and bidding
adieu to my Shepherdess and guide, I immediately hastened towards
the Roman Theatre.<A name="fnref_89"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_89">89</A> The town of Lillebonne has a very picturesque
appearance from the old mound, or raised terrace, along the outer
walls of the castle. In five minutes I mingled with the school boys
who were amusing themselves within the ruins of all that is left of
this probably once vast and magnificent old theatre. It is only by
clearing away a great quantity of earth, with which these ruins are
covered, that you can correctly ascertain their character and state
of preservation. M. Le Prevost bade me remark that the walls had
much swerved from their original perpendicularity,--and that there
was much irregularity in the laying of the bricks among the stones.
But time, design, and accident, have each in turn (in all
probability) so contributed to decompose, deface, and alter the
original aspect of the building, that there is no forming a correct
conjecture as to its ancient form. Earth, grass, trees, flowers,
and weeds, have taken almost entire possession of some low and
massive outer walls; so that the imagination has full play to
supply all deficiencies which appear to the eye.</P>

<P>From the whole of this interesting spot I retreated--with mixed
sensations of melancholy and surprise--to the little auberge of the
<EM>Three Moors</EM>, in the centre of the town. It had begun to
rain smartly as we took shelter in the kitchen; where, for the
first time since leaving England, I saw a display of utensils which
might have vied with our own, or even with a Dutch interior, for
neatness and order of disposition. Some of the dishes might have
been as ancient as--not the old round Tower--but as the last
English Duke of Normandy who might have banquetted there. The whole
was in high polish and full display. On my complimenting the good
<EM>Aubergiste</EM> upon so creditable a sight, she laughed, and
replied briskly--&quot;Ce n&#39;est rien, ceci: Pentecôte est tout
près, et donc vous verrez, Monsieur!&quot;--It should seem that
Whitsuntide was the season for a general household purification.
Some of her furniture had once belonged to the Castle: but she had
bought it, in the scramble which took place at the dispersion and
destruction of the movables there, during the Revolution. I
recommend all travellers to take a lunch, and enjoy a bottle of vin
ordinaire, at <EM>Les Trois-Nègres.</EM> I was obliged to summon up
all my stock of knowledge in polite phraseology, in order to
decline a plate of soup. &quot;It was delicious above every
thing&quot;--&quot;but I had postponed taking dinner till we got to
Bolbec.&quot; &quot; Bon--vous y trouverez un hôtel superbe.&quot;
The French are easily pleased; and civility is so cheap and current
a coin abroad, that I wish our countrymen would make use of it a
little more frequently than they appear to do. I started about two
for Bolbec.</P>

<P>The rain continued during the whole of my route thither; but it
did not prevent me from witnessing a land of plenty and of
picturesque beauty on all sides. Indeed it is scarcely possible to
conceive a more rich and luxuriant state of culture. To the left,
about half a league from Lillebonne, I passed the domain of a once
wealthy, and extremely extensive abbey. They call it the <EM>Abbey
of Valasse.</EM> A long rambling bare stone wall, and portions of a
deserted ruin, kept in sight for full half an English mile. The
immediate approach to BOLBEC is that of the entrance to a modern
and flourishing trading town, which seems to be beginning to
recover from the effects of the Revolution. After Rouen, and even
Caudebec, it has a stiff modernized air. I drove to the principal
inn, opposite the church, and bespoke dinner and a bed. The church
is perfectly, modern, and equally heavy and large. Crowds of people
were issuing from <EM>Vespers</EM>, when, ascending a flight of
steps, (for it is built on ground considerably above the
ground-floor of the inn) I resolved to wait for the final departure
of the congregation, and to take a leisurely survey of the
interior, while dinner was getting ready.</P>

<P>The sexton was a perfect character in his way; old, shrewd,
communicative, and civil. There were several confessionals.
&quot;What--you confess here pretty much?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir; but
chiefly females, and among them many widows.&quot; I had said
nothing to provoke this ungallant reply. &quot;In respect to the
<EM>sacrament</EM>, what is the proportion between the
communicants, as to sex?&quot; &quot;Sir, there are one hundred
women to twelve men.&quot; I wish I could say that this
disproportion were confined to <EM>France</EM>.</P>

<P>Quitting this heavy and ugly, but large and commodious fabric, I
sought the inn and dinner. The cook was in every respect a learned
professor in his art, and the produce of his skill was equally
excellent and acceptable. I had scarcely finished my repast, and
the <EM>Gruyere</EM> cheese and nuts yet lingered upon the table,
when the soft sounds of an organ, accompanied by a youthful voice,
saluted my ears in a very pleasing manner. &quot; C&#39;est LE
PAUVRE PETIT SAVOYARD, Monsieur&quot;--exclaimed the waiter--&quot;
Vous allez entendre un air touchant! Ah, le pauvre
petit!&quot;--&quot;Comment ça?&quot; &quot;Monsieur, il n&#39;a ni
père ni mère; mais pour le chant--oh Dieu, il n&#39;y a personne
qui chante comme le pauvre petit Savoyard!&quot; I was well
disposed to hear the song, and to admit the truth of the
waiter&#39;s observation. The little itinerant stopped opposite the
door, and sung the following air:--</P>

<P class="poetry"><EM>Bon jour, Bon soir</EM>.</P>

<SPAN class="ind8"><EM>Bon soir</EM>.</SPAN></P>

<P>I know not how it was, but had the &quot;petit Savoyard&quot;
possessed the cultivated voice of a chorister, I could not have
listened to his notes with half the satisfaction with which I dwelt
upon his history, as stated by the waiter. He had no sooner
concluded and made his bow, than I bought the slender volume from
which his songs had been chanted, and had a long gossip with him.
He slung his organ upon his back, and &quot;ever and anon&quot;
touching his hat, expressed his thankfulness, as much for the
interest I had taken in his welfare, as for the trifling piece of
silver which I slipt into his hand at parting. Meanwhile all the
benches, placed on the outsides of the houses, were
occupied--chiefly by females--to witness, it should seem, so novel
and interesting a sight as an Englishman holding familiar discourse
with a poor wandering Savoyard! My friend the sexton was among the
spectators, and from his voice and action, appeared especially
interested. &quot;Que le bon Dieu vous bénisse!&quot; exclaimed the
Savoyard, as I bade him farewell. On pursuing my route for a stroll
upon the heights near the town, I had occasion to pass these
benches of spectators. The women, almost without any exception,
inclined their heads by way of a gracious salute; and Monsieur
<EM>le Sacristain</EM> pulled off his enormous cock&#39;d hat with
the consequence of a drum-major. He appeared not to have forgotten
the donation which he had received in the church. Continuing my
pursuit, I gained an elevated situation: whence, looking down upon
the spot where I had left the Savoyard, I observed him surrounded
by the females--each and every one of them apparently convulsed
with laughter! Even the little musician appeared to have forgotten
his &quot;orphan state.&quot;</P>

<P>The environs of <EM>Bolbec</EM>, especially in the upper part,
are sufficiently picturesque. At least they are sufficiently
fruitful: orchards, corn and pasture land--intermixed with meadows,
upon which cotton was spread for bleaching--produced altogether a
very interesting effect. The little hanging gardens, attached to
labourer&#39;s huts, contributed to the beauty of the scene. A warm
crimson sun-set seemed to envelope the coppice wood in a flame of
gold. The road was yet reeking with moisture--and I retraced my
steps, through devious and slippery paths, to the hôtel. Evening
had set in: the sound of the Savoyard&#39;s voice was no longer
heard: I ordered tea and candles, and added considerably to my
journal before I went to bed. I rose at five; and before six the
horses were harnessed to the cabriolet. Having obtained the
necessary instructions for reaching <EM>Tancarville</EM>, (the
ancient and proud seat of the MONTMORENCIS) I paid my reckoning,
and left Bolbec. As I ascended a long and rather steep hill, and,
looking to the right and left, saw every thing in a state of
verdure and promise, I did all I could to persuade myself that the
journey would be agreeable, and that the castle of Montmorenci
could not fail to command admiration. I was now in the high and
broad &quot;<EM>roúte royale</EM>&quot; to Havre le Grace; but had
scarcely been a league upon it, when, looking at my instructions,
we struck out of the high road, to the left, and followed a private
one through flat and uninteresting arable land. I cannot tell how
many turns were taken, or how many pretty little villages were
passed-- till, after a long and gradual ascent, we came upon a
height, flanked the greater part by coppice wood, through one
portion of which--purposely kept open for the view--was seen at a
distance a marvellously fine group of perpendicular rocks (whose
grey and battered sides were lighted up with a pink colour from the
morning sun) in the middle, as it were, of the
<EM>Seine</EM>--which now really assumed an ocean-like appearance.
In fact, these rocks were at a considerable distance, and appeared
to be in the broadest part of the embouchure of that river. I
halted the cabriolet; and gazed with unfeigned delight on this
truly magnificent and fascinating scene!... for the larks were now
mounting all around, and their notes, added to those of the
&quot;songsters of the grove,&quot; produced an effect which I even
preferred to that from the organ and voice of the &quot;pauvre
petit Savoyard.&quot; The postboy partook of my rapture.
&quot;Voilà, Monsieur, des rochers terriblement
perpendiculiers--eh, quelle belle vue de la rivière, et du
paysage!&quot;</P>

<P>Leaving this brilliant picture, we turned rather to the left,
and then found our descent proportionably gradual with the ascent.
The Seine was now right before us, as hasty glimpses of it, through
partial vistos, had enabled us to ascertain. Still
<EM>Tancarville</EM> was deemed a terrible way off. First we were
to go up, and then we were to go down--now to turn to the right,
and afterwards to the left--a sort of
<!-- [Greek: polla d'ananta katanta] -->
&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#945;
&#948;'&#945;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;
&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;
route--when a prepossessing young paysanne told the
postilion, that, after passing through such a wood, we should reach
an avenue, from the further end of which the castle of
<EM>Montmorenci</EM> would be visible .. &quot;une petite lieue de
distance.&quot; Every thing is &quot;une petite lieue!&quot; It is
the answer to every question relating to distance. Though the
league be double a German one, still it is &quot;une petite!&quot;
Here however the paysanne happened to be right. We passed through
the wood, gained the avenue, and from the further end saw--even yet
towering in imposing magnitude--the far- famed <EM>Chateau de
Montmorenci</EM>. It might be a small league off. I gained spirits
and even strength at the sight: told the postilion to mend his
pace--of which he gave immediate and satisfactory demonstration,
while the echoes of his whip resounded along the avenue. A closer
road now received us. Knolls of grass interwoven with moss, on the
summits of which the beech and lime threw up their sturdy stems,
now enclosed the road, which began to widen and to improve in
condition. At length, turning a corner, a group of country people
appeared--&quot;Est-ce ici la route de
Tancarville?&quot;--&quot;Tancarville est tout près: c&#39;est là,
où on voit la fumée des cheminées.&quot; Joyful intelligence! The
post-boy increased his speed: The wheels seemed to move with a
readier play: and in one minute and a half I was upon the beach of
the river Seine, and alighted at the door of the only auberge in
the village.</P>

<P>I know you to be both a lover of and connoisseur in
Rembrandt&#39;s pictures: and especially of those of his
<EM>old</EM> characters. I wish you could have seen the old woman,
of the name of <EM>Bucan</EM>, who came out of this same auberge to
receive us. She had a sharp, quick, constantly moving black eye;
keen features, projecting from a surface of flesh of a subdued
mahogany tint; about her temples, and the lower part of her cheeks,
were all those harmonizing wrinkles which become old age--<EM>upon
canvas</EM>--while, below her chin, communicating with a small and
shrunken neck, was that sort of concavity, or dewlap, which
painters delight to express with a minuteness of touch, and
mellowness of tint, that contribute largely to picturesque effect!
This good old woman received us with perfect elasticity of spirits
and of action. It should seem that we were the first Englishmen who
had visited her solitude this year. Her husband approached, but she
soon ordered him &quot;to the right about&quot;--to prepare fuel,
coffee, and eggs. I was promised the best breakfast that could be
got in Normandy, in twenty minutes. The inn being sufficiently
miserable, I was anxious for a ramble. The tide was now coming up,
as at Caudebec; but the sweep and breadth of the river being, upon
a considerably larger scale, its increase was not yet so
obvious--although I am quite sure that all the flats, which I saw
on my arrival as a bed of mud, were, within a quarter of an hour,
wholly covered with the tide: and, looking up to the right, I
perceived the perpendicular walls of <EM>Montmorenci Castle</EM> to
be washed by the refluent wave. It was a sort of ocean in miniature
before me. A few miserable fishing boats were moored upon the
beach; while a small number of ill-clad and straggling villagers
lingered about the same spot, and seemed to look upon the postboy
and myself as beings dropt from the sky!</P>

<P>On ascending a considerable elevation, I had the gratification
of viewing <EM>Quillebeuf</EM> a little more nearly. It was almost
immediately opposite: while, to the right, contemplating the wide
sweep of the river towards its embouchure, I fancied that I could
see <EM>Havre</EM>. The group of rocks, which had so charmed us on
our journey, now assumed a different character. On descending, I
could discover, although at a considerable distance, the old woman
standing at the door of the auberge--apparently straining her eyes
to catch a glimpse of us; and she was almost disposed to scold for
having put her reputation of giving good breakfasts to so hazardous
a trial. The wood was blazing, and the room was almost filled by
smoke--but a prolonged fast, and a stage of sixteen or eighteen
miles, in a keen morning air, made Mr. Lewis and myself only think
of allaying our hunger. In every public house, however mean, you
see the white metal fork, and the napkin covering the plate. A
dozen boiled eggs, and a coffee pot and cups of perfectly
Brobdignagdian dimensions, with tolerable bread and indifferent
butter, formed the <EM>materiél</EM> of our breakfast. The postboy,
having stabled and refreshed his horses, was regaling himself in
the kitchen--but- how do you think he was regaling himself?--Truly,
in stretching himself upon a bench, and reading, as old Ascham
expresses it, &quot;a merry tale in Boccace.&quot; In other words,
he was reading a French version of the Decameron of that celebrated
author. Indeed, I had already received sufficient proof of the
general propensity of the common people to <EM>read</EM>--whether
good or bad books ... but let us hope and believe the former. I
left the bibliomaniacal postboy to his Boccaccio, and prepared to
visit the CASTLE ... the once proud and yet commanding residence of
the family of MONTMORENCI.</P>

<P>I ascended--with fresh energies imparted from my breakfast. The
day grew soft, and bright, and exhilarating ... but alas! for the
changes and chances of every thing in this transitory world. Where
was the warder? He had ceased to blow his horn for many a long
year. Where was the harp of the minstrel? It had perished two
centuries ago, with the hand that had struck its chords. Where was
the attendant guard?--or pursuivants--or men at arms? They had been
swept from human existence, like the leaves of the old limes and
beech trees by which the lower part of the building was surrounded.
The moat was dry; the rampart was a ruin:--the rank grass grew
within the area ... nor can I tell you how many relics of halls,
banqueting rooms, and bed- rooms, with all the magnificent
appurtenances of old castellated architecture, struck the eager eye
with mixed melancholy and surprise! The singular half-circular, and
half square, corner towers, hanging over the ever-restless wave,
interested me exceedingly. The guide shewed me where the prisoners
used to be kept--in a dungeon, apparently impervious to every
glimmer of day-light, and every breath of air. I cannot pretend to
say at what period even the oldest part of the Castle of
Montmorenci was built: but I saw nothing that seemed to be more
ancient than the latter end of the fifteenth century.<A name=
"fnref_90"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_90">90</A> Perhaps the
greater portion may be of the beginning of the sixteenth; but,
amidst the unroofed rooms, I could not help admiring the painted
borders, chiefly of a red colour, which run along the upper part of
the walls, or wainscoats--giving indication not only of a good, but
of a splendid, taste. Did I tell you that this sort of ornament was
to be seen in some parts of the eastern end of the Abbey of
Jumieges? <EM>Here</EM>, indeed, they afforded evidence--an
evidence, mingled with melancholy sensations on reflection--of the
probable state of magnificence which once reigned throughout the
castle. Between the corner towers, upon that part which runs
immediately parallel with the Seine, there is a noble terrace, now
converted into garden ground--which commands an immediate and
extensive view of the embouchure of the river. It is the property
of a speculator, residing at Havre.</P>

<P>The cabriolet meeting me at the bottom of the mound upon which
the castle is built, (having paid the reckoning before I left the
inn), I had nothing to do but to step in, and push forward for
<EM>Havre</EM>. Retracing the road through which we came, we darted
into the <EM>Route Royale</EM>, and got upon one of the noblest
high roads in France. Between <EM>Tancarville</EM> and
<EM>Havre</EM> lie <EM>Hocher</EM> and <EM>Harfleur</EM>; each
almost at the water&#39;s edge. I regretted I could not see the
former; but on our approach to Harfleur I observed, to the right,
some delightfully situated, and not inelegantly built, country
villas or modern chateaux. The immediate run down to Harfleur is
exceedingly pleasing; and though we trotted sharply through the
town, the exquisite little porch of the church was not lost upon
me. Few places, I believe, for its dimensions, have been more
celebrated in the middle ages than Harfleur. The Seine to the left
becomes broader and bolder; and, before you, beneath some wooded
heights, lies HAVRE. Every thing gives indication of commerce and
prosperity as you gain upon the town. The houses increase in number
and respectability of appearance--&quot;Voyez-vous là, Monsieur, à
droite, ces belles maisons de plaisance?--(exclaimed the
charioteer)--&quot;C&#39;est la où demeurent Messieurs vos
compatriotes: ma foi, ils ont un joli gout.&quot; The first glance
upon these stone houses confirmed the sagacity of the postilion.
They are gloriously situated--facing the ocean; while the
surrounding country teems with fish and game of every species.
Isaac Walton might have contrived to interweave a pretty ballad in
his description of such trout-streams as were those before us.</P>

<P>But we approach the town. The hulls of hundreds of vessels are
seen in the commodious docks; and the flags of merchantmen, from
all quarters of the globe, appear to stream from the mast-heads. It
is a scene of bustle, of business, and variety; and perfectly
English. What a contrast to the gloomy solitude of Montmorenci! The
outer and inner gates are passed. <EM>Diligences</EM> issue from
every quarter. The centinels relieve guard. The sound of horns,
from various packet-boats immediately about to sail, echoes on all
sides.... Driving up the high street, we approached the hôtel of
the <EM>Aigle d&#39;Or,</EM><A name="fnref_91"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_91">91</A> kept by Justin, and considered to be the best.
We were just in time for the table d&#39;hôte, and to bespeak
excellent beds. Travellers were continually arriving and departing.
What life and animation!... We sat down upwards of forty to dinner:
and a good dinner it was. Afterwards, I settled for the cabriolet,
and bade the postboy adieu!-- nor can I suppress my feelings in
saying that, in wishing him farewell, I felt ten times more than I
had ever felt upon taking leave of a postilion.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XI</H3>

<P>HAVRE DE GRACE. HONFLEUR. JOURNEY TO CAEN.</P>

<P><EM>Caen, May</EM>, 1818.</P>

<P>Well, my friend!... I have at length visited the interior of the
Abbey of St. Stephen, and have walked over the grave of WILLIAM THE
CONQUEROR and of MATHILDA his wife. But as you dearly love the
gossip of a travelling journal, I shall take up the thread of my
narrative from the place in which I last addressed
you:--particularly as our route hither was marked by some
circumstances worthy of recital. First, however, for
<EM>Havre</EM>.</P>

<P>I staid there only long enough to express my regret that the
time of my residence could not be extended. It happened to be a
fine afternoon, and I took a leisurely stroll upon the docks and
ramparts.<A name="fnref_92"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_92">92</A> The town was full of animation--whether relating to
business or to pleasure. For the former, you must visit the quays;
for the latter, you must promenade the high street, and more
especially the <EM>Boulevards</EM>, towards the heights. The sun
shone merrily, as it were, upon the thousands of busy, bustling,
and bawling human creatures.. who were in constant locomotion in
this latter place.</P>

<P>What a difference between the respective appearances of the
quays of Dieppe and Havre? Although even <EM>here</EM> things would
assume a rubbishing and littered aspect compared with the quays at
<EM>Liverpool</EM> or at <EM>Hull</EM>, yet it must be admitted,
for the credit of Gallico-Norman commerce, that the quays of Havre
make a very respectable appearance. You see men fiddling, dancing,
sleeping, sitting, and of course talking <EM>à pleine gorge</EM>,
in groups without end--but no drunkenness!.. not even an English
oath saluted my ear. The Southampton packets land their crews at
Havre. I saw the arrival of one of these packets; and was cruel
enough to contrast the animated and elastic spirits of a host of
French <EM>laqnais de place</EM>, tradespeople, &amp;c.--attacking
the passengers with cards of their address--with the feeble
movements and dejected countenances of the objects of their
attack.</P>

<P>From the quays, I sauntered along the ramparts, which are
flanked by broad ditches--of course plentifully supplied with
water; and passing over the drawbridge, by which all carriages
enter the town--and which absolutely trembles as if about to sink
beneath you, as the <EM>diligence</EM> rolls over it.--I made for
the boulevards and tea-gardens; to which, business being well nigh
over, the inhabitants of Havre flock by hundreds and by thousands.
A fine afternoon throws every thing into &quot;good
keeping&quot;--as the artists say. The trees, and meadows, and
upper lands, were not only bright with the sun-beam, but the human
countenance was lighted up with gladness. The occupations partook
of this joyful character. Accordingly there was dancing and singing
on all sides; a little beyond, appeared to sit a group of
philosophers, or politicians, upon a fantastically cut seat,
beneath laburnums streaming with gold; while, still further,
gradually becoming invisible from the foliage and winding path,
strolled pairs in more gentle discourse! Meanwhile the whoop and
halloo of school-boys, in rapid and ceaseless evolutions, resounded
through the air, and heightened the gratification of the
scene....</P>

<P class="poetry">And young and old came out to play<BR>
 Upon a sun-shine holiday.</P>

<P>Gaining a considerable ascent, I observed knolls of rich
verdure, with fine spreading trees, and elegant mansions, to be in
the foreground--in the middle-ground, stood the town of Havre:--in
the distance, rolled and roared the expansive ocean! The sun was
visibly going to rest; but his departing beams yet sparkled upon
the more prominent points of the picture. There was no time for
finishing the subject. After a stroll of nearly a couple of hours,
on this interesting spot, I retraced my steps over the draw-bridge,
and prepared for objects of <EM>still</EM> life; in other words,
for the examination of what might be curious and profitable in the
shape of a <STRONG>boke</STRONG>.</P>

<P>The lamps were lighted when I commenced my <EM>Bibliomaniacal
Voyage</EM> of discovery among the BOOKSELLERS. But what poverty of
materials, for a man educated in the schools of Fust and Caxton! To
every question, about rare or old books, I was told that I should
have been on the Continent when the allies first got possession of
Paris. In fact, I had not a single <EM>trouvaille</EM>.</P>

<P>The packet was to sail by nine the next morning, precisely. For
a wonder, (or rather no wonder at all, considering what had
occurred during the last twenty-four hours) I had an excellent
night&#39;s rest, and was prepared for breakfast by eight. Having
breakfasted, I accompanied my luggage to the inner harbour, and
observed the <EM>Honfleur</EM> packet swarming with passengers, and
crammed with every species of merchandize: especially tubs, casks,
trunks, cordage, and earthenware. We went on board, and took our
stations near the helm; and after experiencing a good deal of
<EM>uncomfortable</EM> heaving of the ocean, got clear from the
mouth of the harbour, and stood out to sea. The tide was running
briskly and strongly into the harbour. We were in truth closely
stowed; and as these packets are built with flattish bottoms, and
low sides, a rough sea would not fail to give to a crew, thus
exposed, the appearance of half-drowned rats. Luckily the wind
began to subside, and by degrees old ocean wore a face of
undisturbed serenity. Our crew was a motley one; but among them, an
Abbess, with a visage of parchment-like rigidity, and with her
broad streaming bands, seemed to experience particular distress.
She was surrounded by some hale, hearty market women, whose robust
forms, and copper-tinted countenances, formed a striking contrast
to her own. A little beyond was an old officer or two, with cocked
hats of the usually capacious dimensions. But the poor Abbess was
cruelly afflicted; and in a gesture and tone of voice, of the most
piteous woe, implored the steward of the vessel for accommodation
below.</P>

<P>Fortunately, as I was not in the least annoyed by sickness, I
had leisure to survey the heights of Honfleur before we landed; and
looking towards the course of the River Seine, as it narrowed in
its windings, I discovered <EM>Harfleur</EM> and <EM>Hocher</EM>
nearly opposite; and, a good deal lower down, the little fishing
town of <EM>Quillebeuf</EM>, apparently embedded in the water.
Honfleur itself is surely among the most miserable of fishing
towns<A name="fnref_93"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_93">93</A>--
or whatever be the staple commodity that supports it. But the
environs make amends for the squalidness of the town. A few years
of peace and plenty would work wonders even in the improvements of
these environs. Perhaps no situation is more favourable for the
luxury of a summer retirement.<A name="fnref_94"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_94">94</A> I paid only eight sous for my passage;
and having no passport to be <EM>viséd</EM> (which indeed was the
case at Havre,) we selected a stout lad or two, from the crowds of
lookers on, as we landed, to carry our luggage to the inn from
which the diligence sets off for CAEN. It surprised us to see with
what alacrity these lads carried the baggage up a steep hill in
their trucks, or barrows; but we were disgusted with the miserable
forms, and miserable clothing, of both sexes, which we encountered
as we proceeded. I was fortunate to be in time to secure my place
in the Diligence. The horses were in the very act of being put to,
as I paid my reckoning beforehand.</P>

<P>Judge of our surprise and gratification on seeing two
well-dressed, and apparently well-bred Englishmen, securing their
places at the same time. It is not always that, at first sight,
Englishmen associate so quickly, and apparently so cordially, as
did these gentlemen with ourselves. They were the Messrs. D*** of
<EM>L</EM>**** <EM>Hall</EM> in Yorkshire: the elder brother an
Oxford man of the same standing with myself. The younger, a Cantab.
We were all bound for Caen; and right gladly did we coalesce upon
this expedition.</P>

<P>We proceeded at a good sharp pace; and as we ascended the very
high hill on the direct road to Caen, with fine leafy trees on each
side, and upon a noble breadth of road, I looked out of the
diligence to enjoy the truly magnificent view of the Seine--with
glimpses of <EM>Harfleur</EM> and <EM>Havre</EM> on the opposite
coast. The cessation of the rain, and the quick movement of the
vehicle, enabled me to do this in a tolerably commodious manner.
The ground however seemed saturated, and the leaves glistened with
the incumbent moisture. There was a sort of pungent freshness of
scent abroad--and a rich pasture land on each side gave the most
luxuriant appearance to the landscape. Nature indeed seemed to have
fructified every thing in a manner at once spontaneous and perfect.
The face of the country is pasture-land throughout; that is to say,
there are comparatively few orchards and little arable. I was told
to pay attention to the cattle, for that the farmers prided
themselves on their property of this kind. They may pride
themselves--if they please: but their pride is not of a lofty cast
of character. I have been in Lincolnshire, Herefordshire, and
Gloucestershire--and have seen and enjoyed, in these counties,
groups of cattle which appeared calculated for the land and the
table of giants, compared with the Lilliputian objects, of the
bucoline species, which were straying, in thin flocks, through the
luxuriant pastures of Normandy. That triumphant and immutable maxim
of &quot;small bone and large carcase&quot; seems, alas! to be
unknown in these regions.</P>

<P>However, on we rode--and gazed on all sides. At length we
reached <EM>Pont L&#39;Eveque</EM>, a pretty long stage; where we
dined (says my journal) upon roast fowl, asparagus, trout, and an
excellent omelette, with two good bottles of vin ordinaire--which
latter, for four Englishmen, was commendably moderate. During
dinner the rain came down again in yet heavier torrents--the
gutters foamed, and the ground smoked with the unceasing fall of
the water. In the midst of this aquatic storm, we toasted Old
England right merrily and cordially; and the conducteur, seeing us
in good humour, told us that &quot;we need not hurry, for that he
preferred a dry journey to a wet one.&quot; We readily assented to
this position; but within half an hour, the weather clearing, we
remounted: and by four o&#39;clock, we all got inside--and
politics, religion, literature, and the fine arts, kept us in
constant discourse and good humour as we rolled on for many a
league. All the way to <EM>Troarn</EM> (the last stage on this side
of Caen) the country presents a truly lovely picture of pasture
land. There are occasionally some wooded heights, in which English
wealth and English taste would have raised villas of the prettiest
forms, and with most commanding views. Yet there is nothing to be
mentioned in the same breath with the country about Rodwell in
Glocestershire. Nor are the trees of the same bulk and luxuriant
foliage as are those in our own country. A fine oak is as rare as
an uncut <EM>Wynkyn de Worde</EM>:<A name="fnref_95"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_95">95</A> but creeping rivulets, rich coppice
wood, avenues of elms and limes, and meadows begemmed with
butter-cups--these are the characteristics of the country through
which we were passing. It is in vain however you look for neat
villas or consequential farm houses: and as rarely do you see
groups of villagers reposing, or in action. A dearth of population
gives to French landscape a melancholy and solitary cast of
character. It is in cities that you must look for human beings--and
<EM>for</EM> cities the French seem to have been created.</P>

<P>It was at <EM>Troarn</EM>, I think, or at some halting place
beyond, that our passports were demanded, and the examination of
our trunks solicited. We surrendered our keys most willingly. The
gentlemen, with their cocked hats and blue jackets--having a belt
from which a sword was suspended--consulted together for a minute
only--returned our keys--and telling us that matters would be
thoroughly looked into at Caen, said they would give us no trouble.
We were of course not sorry at this determination--and the Messrs.
D---and myself getting once more into the cabriolet, (a postboy
being secured for the leaders) we began to screw up our spirits and
curiosity for a view of the steeples of CAEN. Unluckily the sun had
set, and the horizon had become gloomy, when we first discovered
the spires of <EM>St. Stephen&#39;s Abbey</EM>--the principal
ecclesiastical edifice at Caen. It was hard upon nine o&#39;clock;
and the evening being extremely dusky, we had necessarily a very
indistinct view of the other churches--but, to my eye, as seen in a
lengthened view, and through a deceitful atmosphere, Caen had the
appearance of OXFORD on a diminutive scale. The town itself, like
our famous University, is built in a slanting direction; though the
surrounding country is yet flatter than about Oxford. As we entered
it, all the population seemed collected to witness our arrival.
From solitude we plunged at once into tumult, bustle, and noise. We
stopped at the <EM>Hotel d&#39;Espagne--</EM>a large, but black and
begrimed mansion. Here our luggage was taken down; and here we were
assailed by garçons de place, with cards in their hands, intreating
us to put up at their respective hotels. We had somehow got a
recommendation to the <EM>Hotel Royale, Place Royale</EM>, and such
a union of <EM>royal</EM> adjuncts was irresistible. Accordingly,
we resolved upon moving thither. In a trice our trunks were placed
upon barrows: and we marched behind, &quot;in double quick
time,&quot; in order to secure our property. The town appeared to
improve as we made our different turnings, and gained upon our
hotel. &quot;Le voilà, Messieurs&quot;--exclaimed our guides and
baggage-conductors--as we got into a goodly square, and saw a fair
and comely mansion in front. The rush of landlord, waiting maids,
and garçons de place, encountered us as we entered.
&quot;Messieurs, je vous salue,&quot;--said a huge, ungracious
looking figure:--which said figure was nothing less than the master
of the hotel--Mons. Lagouelle. We were shown into a small room on
the ground floor, to the right--and ordered tea; but had scarcely
begun to enjoy the crackling blaze of a plentiful wood fire, when
the same ungracious figure took his seat by the side of us ... to
tell us &quot;all about THE DUEL.&quot;</P>

<P>I had heard (from an English gentleman in the packet boat from
Havre to Honfleur) something respecting this most extraordinary
duel between a young Englishman and a young Frenchman: but as I
mean to reserve my <EM>Caen budget</EM> for a distinct dispatch,
and as I have yet hardly tarried twenty hours in this place, I must
bid you adieu; only adding that I dreamt, last night, about some
English antiquaries trying to bend the bow of William the
Conqueror!--Can this be surprising? Again farewell.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XII.</H3>

<P>CAEN. SOIL. SOCIETY. EDUCATION. A DUEL. OLD HOUSES. THE ABBEY OF
ST. STEPHEN. CHURCH OF ST. PIERRE DE DARNETAL. ABBÉ DE LA SAINTE
TRINITÉ. OTHER PUBLIC EDIFICES.</P>

<P>I have now resided upwards of a week at Lagouelle&#39;s, the
<EM>Hotel Royale</EM>, and can tell you something of the place and
of the inhabitants of CAEN. Caen however is still-life after Rouen:
but it has been, and yet is, a town exceedingly well-deserving the
attention of the lounging traveller and of the curious antiquary.
Its ecclesiastical edifices are more ancient, but less vast and
splendid, than those of Rouen; while the streets and the houses are
much more wide and comfortable. This place is the capital of the
department of CALVADOS, or of LOWER NORMANDY: and its population is
estimated at forty thousand souls. It has a public library, a
school of art, a college, mayoralty, and all the adjuncts of a
corporate society.<A name="fnref_96"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_96">96</A> But I must first give you something in the shape of
political economy intelligence. Caen with its arrondissemens of
<EM>Bayeux, Vire, Falaise, Lisieux, Pont L&#39;Eveque</EM>, is the
country of pasturage and of cattle. It is also fertile in the apple
and pear; and although at <EM>Argences</EM> there have been
vineyards from time immemorial, yet the produce of the grape, in
the character of <EM>wine</EM>,<A name="fnref_97"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_97">97</A> is of a very secondary description.
There are beautiful and most abundant market gardens about Caen;
and for the last seventy years they have possessed a garden for the
growth and cultivation of foreign plants and trees. It is said that
more than nine hundred species of plants and trees are to be found
in the department of CALVADOS, of which some (but I know not how
many or how few) are considered as indigenous. Of forests and
woods, the number is comparatively small; and upon that limited
number great injuries were inflicted by the Revolution. In the
arrondissement of Caen itself, there are only 344
<EM>hectares</EM>.<A name="fnref_98"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_98">98</A> The truth is, that in the immediate neighbourhood
of populous towns, the French have no idea of PLANTING. They suffer
plain after plain, and hill after hill, to be denuded of trees, and
make no provision for the supply of those who are to come after
them. Thus, not only a great portion of the country about
Rouen--(especially in the direction of the road leading to Caen--)
is gradually left desolate and barren, but even here, as you
approach the town, there is a dreary flatness of country,
unrefreshed by the verdure of foliage: whereas the soil, kind and
productive by nature, requires only the slightest attention of man
to repay him a hundred fold. What they will do some fifty years
hence for <EM>fuel</EM>, is quite inconceivable. It is true that
the river Orne, by means of the tide, and of its proximity to the
sea, brings up vessels of even 200 tons burthen, in which they may
stow plenty of wood; but still, the expenses of carriage, and
duties of a variety of description--together with the
<EM>dependence</EM> of the town upon such accidental supply--would
render the article of fuel a most expensive concern. It is also
true that they pretend that the soil, in the department of
Calvados, contains <EM>coal</EM>; but the experiments which were
made some years ago at <EM>Littry</EM>, in the arondissement of
<EM>Bayeux</EM>, should forbid the Caennois to indulge any very
sanguine expectations on that score.</P>

<P>In respect to the trade of the town, the two principal branches
are <EM>lace</EM> and <EM>cap</EM> making. The former trade is
divided with Bayeux; and both places together give occupation to
about thirty thousand pairs<A name="fnref_99"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_99">99</A> of hands. People of all ages may be so
employed; and the annual gross receipts have been estimated at four
millions of francs. In <EM>cap</EM> making only, at Caen, four
thousand people have been constantly engaged, and a gross produce
of two millions of francs has been the result of that branch of
trade. A great part of this manufacture was consumed at home; but
more than one half used to be exported to Spain, Portugal, and the
colonies belonging to France. They pretend to say, however, that
this article of commerce is much diminished both in profit and
reputation: while that of <EM>table linen</EM> is gaining
proportionably in both.<A name="fnref_100"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_100">100</A> There were formerly great <EM>tanneries</EM>
in Caen and its immediate vicinity, but lately that branch of trade
has suffered extremely. The revolution first gave it a violent
check, and the ignorance and inattention of the masters to recent
improvements, introduced by means of chemistry, have helped to
hasten its decay. To balance this misfortune, there has of late
sprung up a very general and judiciously directed commercial spirit
in the article of <EM>porcelaine</EM>; and if Caen be inferior to
its neighbouring towns, and especially to Rouen and Lisieux, in the
articles of cloth, stuffs, and lace, it takes a decided lead in
that which relates to <EM>pottery</EM> and <EM>china</EM>: no mean
articles in the supply of domestic wants and luxuries. But it is in
matters of higher &quot;pith and moment&quot; that Caen may claim a
superiority over the towns just noticed. There is a better spirit
of <EM>education</EM> abroad; and, for its size, more science and
more literature will be found in it.</P>

<P>This place has been long famous for the education of Lawyers.
There are two distinct academies--one for &quot;Science and the
Belles-Lettres&quot;--the other for agriculture and commerce. The
<EM>Lycée</EM> is a noble building, close to the Abbey of St.
Stephen: but I wish its façade had been Gothic, to harmonise with
the Abbey. Indeed, Caen has quite the air of Oxford, from the
prevalent appearance of <EM>stone</EM> in its public buildings. The
environs of the town afford quarries, whence the stone is taken in
great blocks, in a comparatively soft state--and is thus cut into
the several forms required with the greatest facility. It is then
exposed, and every succeeding day appears to add to its white tint
and durable quality. I saw some important improvements making in
the outskirts of the town,<A name="fnref_101"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_101">101</A> in which they were finishing shafts and
capitals of columns in a manner the most correct and gratifying.
Still farther from the immediate vicinity of Caen, they find stone
of a closer grain; and with this they make stair- cases, and
pavements for the interior of buildings. Indeed the stone stair-
cases in this place, which are usually circular, and projecting
from the building, struck me as being equally curious and uncommon.
It is asserted that they have different kinds of <EM>marble</EM> in
the department of Calvados, which equal that of the south of
France. At <EM>Basly</EM> and <EM>Vieux</EM> white marble is found
which has been judged worthy of a comparison with Parian; but this
is surely a little presumptuous. However, it is known that Cardinal
Richelieu brought from Vieux all the marble with which he built the
chapel in the college of the Sorbonne.</P>

<P>Upon the whole, as to general appearance, and as to particular
society, Caen may be preferable to Rouen. The costume and manners
of the common people are pretty much, if not entirely, the same;
except that, as to dress, the <EM>cauchoise</EM> is here rather
more simple than at Dieppe and Rouen. The upper fille-de-chambre at
our hotel displays not only a good correct model of national dress,
but she is well-looking in her person, and well-bred in her
manners. Mr. Lewis prevailed upon this good-natured young woman to
sit for her likeness, and for the sake of her costume. The
girl&#39;s eyes sparkled with more than ordinary joy at the
proposal, and even an expression of gratitude mingled itself in her
manner of compliance. I send you the figure and dress of the
fille-de-chambre at the <EM>Hotel Royale</EM> of Caen.<A name=

</DIV>

<P>Caen is called the dépôt of the English.<A name=
"fnref_103"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_103">103</A> In truth
there is an amazing number of our countrymen here, and from very
different causes. One family comes to reside from motives of
economy; another from those of education; a third from those of
retirement; and a fourth from pure love of sitting down, in a
strange place, with the chance of making some pleasant connection,
or of being engaged in seeking some strange adventure: Good and
cheap living, and novel society, are doubtless the main
attractions. But there is desperate ill blood just now between the
<EM>Caennois</EM> (I will not make use of the enlarged term
<EM>Francois</EM>) and the English; and I will tell you the cause.
Do you remember the emphatic phrase in my last, &quot;all about the
duel?&quot; Listen. About three weeks only before our arrival,<A
name="fnref_104"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_104">104</A> a duel
was fought between a young French law-student, and a young
Englishman; the latter the son of a naval captain. I will mention
no names; and so far not wound the feelings of the friends of the
parties concerned. But this duel, my friend, has been &quot;THE
DUEL OF DUELS&quot;--on the score of desperation, and of a fixed
purpose to murder. It is literally without precedent, and I trust
will never be considered as one. You must know then, that Caen, in
spite of all the &quot;bouleversemens&quot; of the Revolution, has
maintained its ancient reputation of possessing a very large
seminary, or college for students at law. These students amount to
nearly 600 in number. Most young gentlemen under twenty years of
age are at times riotous, or frolicsome, or foolish. Generally
speaking, however, the students conduct themselves with propriety:
but there had been a law-suit between a French and English suitor,
and the Judge pronounced sentence in favour of our countryman. The
hall was crowded with spectators, and among them was a plentiful
number of law-students. As they were retiring, one young Frenchman
either made frightful faces, or contemptible gestures, in a very
fixed and insulting manner, at a young Englishman--the son of this
naval captain. Our countryman had no means or power of noticing or
resenting the insult, as the aggressor was surrounded by his
companions. It so happened that it was fair time at Caen; and in
the evening of the same day, our countryman recognised, in the
crowd at the fair, the physiognomy of the young man who had
insulted him in the hall of justice. He approached him, and gave
him to understand that his rude behaviour should be noticed at a
proper time and in a proper place: whereupon the Frenchman came up
to him, shook him violently by the arm, and told him to &quot;fix
his distance on the ensuing morning.&quot; Now the habit of
duelling is very common among these law-students; but they measure
twenty-five paces, fire, and of course ... MISS--and then fancy
themselves great heroes ... and there is an end of the affair. Not
so upon the present occasion. &quot;Fifteen paces,&quot; if you
please-- said the student, sarcastically, with a conviction of the
backwardness of his opponent to meet him. &quot;FIVE,
rather&quot;--exclaimed the provoked Englishman--&quot;I will fight
you at FIVE paces:&quot;--and it was agreed that they should meet
and fight on the morrow, at five paces only asunder.</P>

<P>Each party was under twenty; but I believe the English youth had
scarcely attained his nineteenth year. What I am about to relate
will cause your flesh to creep. It was determined by the seconds,
as <EM>one</EM> must necessarily <EM>fall</EM>, from firing at so
short a distance, that only <EM>one</EM> pistol should be loaded
with <EM>ball</EM>: the other having nothing but
<EM>powder</EM>:--and that, as the Frenchman had challenged, he was
to have the choice of the pistols. They parted. The seconds
prepared the pistols according to agreement, and the fatal morning
came. The combatants appeared, without one jot of abatement of
spirit or of cool courage. The pistols lay upon the grass before
them: one loaded only with powder, and the other with powder and
ball. The Frenchman advanced: took up a pistol, weighed and
balanced it most carefully in his hand, and then ... laid it down.
He seized the other pistol, and cocking it, fixed himself upon the
spot from whence he was to fire. The English youth was necessarily
compelled to take the abandoned pistol. Five paces were then
measured ... and on the signal being given, they both fired ... and
the Frenchman fell ... DEAD UPON THE SPOT! The Frenchman had in
fact <EM>taken up</EM>, but afterwards <EM>laid down</EM>, the very
pistol which was loaded with the fatal <EM>ball</EM>--on the
supposition that it was of too light a weight; and even seemed to
compliment himself upon his supposed sagacity on the occasion. But
to proceed. The ball went through his heart, as I understood. The
second of the deceased on seeing his friend a reeking corpse at his
feet, became mad and outrageous ... and was for fighting the
survivor immediately! Upon which, the lad of mettle and courage
replied, that he would not fight a man without a
<EM>second</EM>--&quot;But go,&quot; said he, (drawing his watch
coolly from his fob). I will give you twenty minutes to come back
again with your second.&quot; He waited, with his watch in his
hand, and by the dead body of his antagonist, for the return of the
Frenchman; but on the expiration of the time, his own second
conjured him to consult his safety and depart; for that, from
henceforth, his life was in jeopardy. He left the ground; obtained
his passport, and quitted the town instantly ... The dead body of
his antagonist was then placed on a bier: and his funeral was
attended by several hundreds of his companions--who, armed with
muskets and swords, threatened destruction to the civil and
military authorities if they presumed to interfere. All this has
necessarily increased the ill- blood which is admitted to exist
between the English and French ... but the affair is now beginning
to blow over.<A name="fnref_105"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_105">105</A></P>

<P>A truce to such topics. It is now time to furnish you with some
details relating to your favourite subjects of ARCHITECTURAL
ANTIQUITIES and BIBLIOGRAPHY. The former shall take precedence.
First of the <EM>streets</EM>; secondly of the <EM>houses</EM>; and
thirdly of the <EM>public buildings</EM>; ecclesiastical and
civil.</P>

<P>To begin with the STREETS. Those of <EM>St. Pierre, Notre
Dame</EM>, and <EM>St. Jean</EM> are the principal for bustle and
business. The first two form one continuous line, leading to the
abbey of St. Stephen, and afford in fact a very interesting stroll
to the observer of men and manners. The shops are inferior to those
of Rouen, but a great shew of business is discernible in them. The
street beyond the abbey, and those called <EM>Guilbert</EM>, and
<EM>des Chanoines</EM>, leading towards the river, are considered
among the genteelest. Ducarel pronounced the <EM>houses</EM> of
Caen &quot;mean in general, though usually built of stone;&quot;
but I do not agree with him in this conclusion. The open parts
about the <EM>Lycée</EM> and the <EM>Abbey of St. Stephen</EM>,
together with the <EM>Place Royale</EM>, where the library is
situated, form very agreeable spaces for the promenade of the
ladies and the exercise of the National Guard. The <EM>Courts</EM>
are full of architectural curiosities, but mostly of the time of
Francis I. Of <EM>domestic</EM> architecture, those houses, with
elaborate carvings in wood, beneath a pointed roof, are doubtless
of the greatest antiquity. There are a great number of these; and
some very much older than others.</P>

<P>A curious old house is to the right hand corner of the street
<EM>St. Jean</EM>: as you go to the Post Office. But I must inform
you that the residence of the famous MALHERBE yet exists in the
street leading to the Abbey of St. Stephen. This house is of the
middle of the sixteenth century: and what Corneille is to
<EM>Rouen</EM>, Malherbe is to <EM>Caen</EM>. &quot;ICI NAQUIT
MALHERBE,&quot; &amp;c. as you will perceive from the annexed view
of this house, inscribed upon the front of the building. Malherbe
has been doomed to receive greater honours. His head was first
struck, in a series of medals, to perpetuate the resemblances of
the most eminent literary characters (male and female) in France:
and it is due to the amiable Pierre-Aimé Lair to designate him as
the FATHER of this medallic project.</P>

<P>In perambulating this town, one cannot but be surprised at the
absence of <EM>Fountains</EM>--those charming pieces of
architecture and of street embellishment. In this respect, Rouen
has infinitely the advantage of Caen: where, instead of the
trickling current of translucent water, we observe nothing but the
partial and perturbed stream issuing from ugly <EM>wells</EM><A
name="fnref_106"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_106">106</A> as
tasteless in their structure as they are inconvenient in the
procuring of water. Upon one or two of these wells, I observed the
dates of 1560 and 1588.</P>

<P>The PUBLIC EDIFICES, however, demand a particular and
appropriate description: and first of those of the ecclesiastical
order. Let us begin therefore with the ABBEY OF ST. STEPHEN; for it
is the noblest and most interesting on many accounts. It is called
by the name of that Saint, inasmuch as there stood formerly a
chapel, on the same site, dedicated to him. The present building
was completed and solemnly dedicated by William the Conqueror, in
the presence of his wife, his two sons Robert and William, his
favourite Archbishop Lanfranc, John Archbishop of Rouen, and Thomas
Archbishop of York--towards the year 1080: but I strongly suspect,
from the present prevailing character of the architecture, that
nothing more than the west front and the towers upon which the
spires rest, remain of its ancient structure. The spires (as the
Abbé De La Rue conjectures, and as I should also have thought) are
about two centuries later than the towers.</P>

<P>The outsides of the side aisles appear to be of the thirteenth,
rather than of the end of the eleventh, century. The first exterior
view of the west front, and of the towers, is extremely
interesting; from the grey and clear tint, as well as excellent
quality, of the stone, which, according to Huet, was brought partly
from Vaucelle and partly from Allemagne.<A name="fnref_107"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_107">107</A> One of the corner abutments of
one of the towers has fallen down; and a great portion of what
remains seems to indicate rapid decay. The whole stands indeed
greatly in need of reparation. Ducarel, if I remember rightly,<A
name="fnref_108"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_108">108</A> has
made, of this whole front, a sort of elevation, as if it were
intended for a wooden model to work by: having all the stiffness
and precision of an erection of forty-eight hours standing only.
The central tower is of very stunted dimensions, and overwhelmed by
a roof in the form of an extinguisher. This, in fact, was the
consequence of the devastations of the Calvinists; who absolutely
sapped the foundation of the tower, with the hope of overwhelming
the whole choir in ruin--but a part only of their malignant object
was accomplished. The component parts of the eastern extremity are
strangely and barbarously miscellaneous. However, no good
commanding exterior view can be obtained from the <EM>place</EM>,
or confined square, opposite the towers.</P>

<P>But let us return to the west-front; and opening the unfastened
green- baize covered door, enter softly and silently into the
venerable interior--sacred even to the feelings of Englishmen! Of
this interior, very much is changed from its original character.
The side aisles retain their flattened arched roofs and pillars;
and in the nave you observe those rounded pilasters--or
alto-rilievo-like pillars--running from bottom to top, which are to
be seen in the abbey of Jumieges. The capitals of these long
pillars are comparatively of modern date. To the left on entrance,
within a side chapel, is the burial place of MATILDA, the wife of
the Conqueror. The tombstone attesting her interment is undoubtedly
of the time. Generally speaking, the interior is cold, and dull of
effect. The side chapels, of which not fewer than sixteen encircle
the choir, have the discordant accompaniments of Grecian
balustrades to separate them from the choir and nave. There is a
good number of <EM>Confessionals</EM> within them; and at one of
these I saw, for the first time, <EM>two</EM> women, kneeling, in
the act of confession to the <EM>same priest</EM>. &quot;C&#39;est
un peu fort,&quot; observed our guide in an under-voice, and with a
humourous expression of countenance! Meanwhile Mr. Lewis, who was
in an opposite direction in the cathedral, was exercising his
pencil in the following delineation of a similar subject.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/219.png" alt="Confession"></DIV>

<P>To the right of the choir (in the sacristy, I think,) is hung
the huge portrait, in oil, within a black and gilt frame, of which
Ducarel has published an engraving, on the supposition of its being
the portrait of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. But nothing can be more
ridiculous than such a conclusion. In the first place, the picture
itself, which is a palpable copy, cannot be older than a century;
and, in the second place, were it an original performance, it could
not be older than the time of Francis I:-- when, in fact, it
purports to have been executed--as a faithful copy of the figure of
King William, seen by the Cardinals in 1522, who were seized with a
sacred phrenzy to take a peep at the body as it might exist at that
time! The costume of the oil-painting is evidently that of the
period of our Henry VIII.; and to suppose that the body of
William--even had it remained in so surprisingly perfect a state as
Ducarel intimates, after an interment of upwards of four hundred
years--could have presented such a costume, when, from
Ducarel&#39;s own statement, another whole-length representation of
the same person is <EM>totally different</EM>--and more decidedly
of the character of William&#39;s time--is really quite a reproach
to any antiquary who plumes himself upon the possession even of
common sense.</P>

<P>In the middle of the choir, and just before the high altar, the
body of the Conqueror was entombed with great pomp; and a monument
erected to his memory of the most elaborate and costly description.
Nothing now remains but a flat black marble slab, with a short
inscription, of quite a recent date.</P>

<P>In the present state of the abbey,<A name="fnref_109"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_109">109</A> and even in that of
Ducarel&#39;s time, there is, and was, a great dearth of sepulchral
monuments. Indeed I know not whether you need be detained another
minute within the interior; except it be, to add your share of
admiration to that which has been long and justly bestowed on the
huge organ<A name="fnref_110"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_110">110</A> at the west end of the nave, which is considered
to be the finest in all France. But Normandy abounds in church
decorations of this kind. Leaving therefore this venerable pile,
endeared to the British antiquary by a thousand pleasing
associations of ideas, we strike off into an adjoining court yard,
and observe the ruins of a pretty extensive pile of building, which
is called by Ducarel the <EM>Palace of the Conqueror</EM>. But in
this supposed palace, in its <EM>present</EM> state, most assuredly
William I. <EM>never</EM> resided: for it is clearly not older than
the thirteenth century: if so ancient. Ducarel saw a great deal
more than is now to be seen; for, in fact, as I attempted to gain
entrance into what appeared to be the principal room, I was stopped
by an old woman, who assured me &quot;qu&#39;il n&#39;y avoit rien
que du chauffage.&quot; It was true enough: the whole of the
untenanted interior contained nothing but wood fuel. Returning to
the principal street, and making a slight digression to the right,
you descend somewhat abruptly by the side of a church in ruins,
called <EM>St. Etienne le Vieil</EM>. In Ducarel&#39;s time this
church is described as entire. On the exterior of one of the
remaining buttresses is a whole length figure, about four English
feet in height (as far as I could guess by the eye) of a man on
horseback--mutilated-- trampling upon another man at its feet.</P>

<P>It is no doubt a curious and uncommon ornament. But, would you
believe it? this figure also, in the opinion of Bourgueville,<A
name="fnref_111"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_111">111</A> was
intended for William the the Conqueror--representing his triumphant
entry into Caen! As an object of art, even in its present mutilated
state, it is highly interesting; and I rejoice that Mr. Cotman is
likely to preserve the little that remains from the hazard of
destruction by the fidelity of his own copy of it.<A name=
"fnref_112"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_112">112</A> It is quite
clear that, close to the figure, you discover traces of style which
are unequivocally of the time of Francis I. The interior of what
remains of this consecrated edifice is converted &quot;horresco
referens&quot; into a receptacle for ... carriages for hire. Not
far from this spot stood formerly a magnificent CROSS--demolished
during the memorable visit of the Calvinists.<A name=
"fnref_113"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_113">113</A> In the way
to the abbey of the Trinity, quite at the opposite or eastern
extremity of the town, you necessarily pass along the <EM>Rue St.
Pierre</EM>, and enter into the market-place, affording an opening
before the most beautiful church in all Normandy. It is the church
of <EM>St. Pierre de Darnetal</EM> of which I now speak, and from
which the name of the street is derived. The tower and spire are of
the most admirable form and workmanship.<A name="fnref_114"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_114">114</A> The extreme delicacy and
picturesque effect of the stone tiles, with which the spire is
covered, as well as the lightness and imposing consequence given to
the tower upon which the spire rests, are of a character peculiar
to itself. The whole has a charming effect. But severe criticism
compels one to admit that the body of the church is defective in
fine taste and unity of parts. The style is not only florid Gothic,
but it is luxuriant, even to rankness, if I may so speak. The parts
are capriciously put together: filled, and even crammed, with
ornaments of apparently all ages: concluding with the Grecian
mixture introduced in the reign of Francis I. The buttresses are,
however, generally, lofty and airy. In the midst of this
complicated and corrupt style of architecture, the tower and spire
rise like a structure built by preternatural hands; and I am not
sure that, at this moment, I can recollect any thing of equal
beauty and effect in the whole range of ecclesiastical edifices in
our own country. Look at this building, from any part of the town,
and you must acknowledge that it has the strongest claims to
unqualified admiration.<A name="fnref_115"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_115">115</A> The body of the church is of very
considerable dimensions. I entered it on a Sunday morning, about
eleven o&#39;clock, and found it quite filled with a large
congregation, in which the <EM>cauchoise</EM>, as usual, appeared
like a broad white mass--from one end to the other. The priests
were in procession. One of the most magnificent organs imaginable
was in full intonation, with every stop opened; the voices of the
congregation were lustily exercised; and the offices of religion
were carried on in a manner which would seem to indicate a warm
sense of devotion among the worshippers. There is a tolerably good
set of modern paintings (the best which I have yet seen in the
interior of a church) of the <EM>Life of Christ</EM>, in the side
chapels. The eastern extremity, or the further end of <EM>Our
Lady&#39;s Chapel</EM>, is horribly bedaubed and over-loaded with
the most tasteless specimens of what is called Gothic art, perhaps
ever witnessed! The great bell of this church, which has an
uncommonly deep and fine tone, is for ever</P>

<P class="poetry">Swinging slow with solemn roar!</P>

<P>that is to say:--it is tolling from five in the morning till ten
at night; so incessantly, in one side-chapel or another, are these
offices carried on within this maternal parish church.<A name=
"fnref_116"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_116">116</A></P>

<P>I saw, with momentary astonishment, the leaning tower of a
church in the <EM>Rue St. Jean</EM>,<A name="fnref_117"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_117">117</A> which is one of the principal
streets in the town: and which is terminated by the <EM>Place des
Cazernes</EM>, flanked by the river Orne. In this street I was
asked, by a bookseller, two pounds two shillings, for a thumbed and
cropt copy of the <EM>Elzevir-Heinsius Horace</EM> of 1629; but
with which demand I did not of course comply. In fact, they have
the most extravagant notions of the prices of Elzevirs, both here
and at Rouen.</P>

<P>You must now attend me to the most interesting public building,
perhaps all things considered, which is to be seen at Caen. I mean,
the <EM>Abbey of the Holy Trinity</EM>, or L&#39;ABBAYE AUX
DAMES.<A name="fnref_118"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_118">118</A> This abbey was founded by the wife of the
Conqueror, about the same time that William erected that of St.
Stephen. Ducarel&#39;s description of it, which I have just seen in
a copy of the <EM>Anglo-Norman Antiquities</EM>, in a
bookseller&#39;s shop, is sufficiently meagre. His plates are also
sufficiently miserable: but things are strangely altered since his
time. The nave of the church is occupied by a manufactory for
making cordage, or twine; and upwards of a hundred lads are now
busied in their <EM>flaxen</EM> occupations, where formerly the nun
knelt before the cross, or was occupied in auricular confession.
The entrance at the western extremity is entirely stopped up: but
the exterior gives manifest proof of an antiquity equal to that of
the Abbey of St. Stephen. The upper part of the towers are palpably
of the fifteenth, or rather of the early part of the sixteenth
century. I had no opportunity of judging of the neat pavement of
the floor of the nave, in white and black marble, as noticed by
Ducarel, on account of the occupation of this part of the building
by the manufacturing children; but I saw some very ancient
tomb-stones (one I think of the twelfth century) which had been
removed from the nave or side aisles, and were placed against the
sides of the north transept. The nave is entirely <EM>walled
up</EM> from the transepts, but the choir is fortunately preserved;
and a more perfect and interesting specimen of its kind, of the
same antiquity, is perhaps no where to be seen in Normandy. All the
monuments as well as the altars, described by Ducarel, are now
taken away. Having ascended a stone staircase, we got into the
upper part of the choir, above the first row of pillars--and walked
along the wall. This was rather adventurous, you will say: but a
more adventurous spirit of curiosity had nearly proved fatal to me:
for, on quitting daylight, we pursued a winding stone staircase, in
our way to the central tower--to enjoy from hence a view of the
town. I almost tremble as I relate it. There had been put up a sort
of temporary wooden staircase, leading absolutely to ... nothing:
or, rather, to a dark void space. I happened to be foremost in
ascending, yet groping in the dark--with the guide luckily close
behind me. Having reached the topmost step, I was raising my foot
to a supposed higher or succeeding step ... but there was
<EM>none</EM>. A depth of eighteen feet at least was below me. The
guide caught my coat, as I was about to lose my balance--and roared
out &quot;Arrêtez--tenez!&quot; The least balance or inclination,
one way or the other, is sufficient, upon these critical occasions:
when luckily, from his catching my coat, and pulling me in
consequence slightly backwards, my fall ... and my LIFE ... were
equally saved! I have reason from henceforth to remember the ABBAYE
AUX DAMES at Caen.</P>

<P>I gained the top of the central tower, which is not of equal
altitude with those of the western extremity, and from thence
surveyed the town, as well as the drizzling rain would permit. I
saw enough however to convince me that the site of this abbey is
fine and commanding. Indeed it stands nearly upon the highest
ground in the town. Ducarel had not the glorious ambition to mount
to the top of the tower; nor did he even possess that most
commendable of all species of architectural curiosity, a wish to
visit the CRYPT. Thus, in either extremity--I evinced a more
laudable spirit of enterprise than did my old-fashioned
predecessor. Accordingly, from the summit, you must accompany me to
the lowest depth of the building. I descended by the same (somewhat
intricate) route, and I took especial care to avoid all
&quot;temporary wooden stair-cases.&quot; The crypt, beneath the
choir, is perhaps of yet greater interest and beauty than the choir
itself. Within an old, very old, stone coffin--at the further
circular end--are the pulverized remains of one of the earliest
Abbesses.<A name="fnref_119"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_119">119</A> I gazed around with mixed sensations of
veneration and awe, and threw myself back into centuries past,
fancying that the shrouded figure of MATILDA herself glided by,
with a look as if to approve of my antiquarian enthusiasm! Having
gratified my curiosity by a careful survey of this subterraneous
abode, I revisited the regions of day-light, and made towards the
large building, now a manufactory, which in Ducarel&#39;s time had
been a nunnery. The revolution has swept away every human being in
the character of a nun; but the director of the manufactory shewed
me, with great civility, some relics of old crosses, rings, veils,
lachrymatories, &amp;c. which had been taken from the crypt I had
recently visited. These relics savoured of considerable antiquity.
Tom Hearne would have set about proving that they <EM>must</EM>
have belonged to Matilda herself; but I will have neither the
presumption nor the merit of attempting this proof. They seemed
indeed to have undergone half a dozen decompositions. Upon the
whole, if our Antiquarian Society, after having exhausted the
cathedrals of their own country, should ever think of perpetuating
the principal ecclesiastical edifices of Normandy, by means of the
<EM>Art of Engraving</EM>, let them begin their labours with the
ABBAYE AUX DAMES at Caen.</P>

<P>The foregoing, my dear friend, are the principal ecclesiastical
buildings in this place. There are other public edifices, but
comparatively of a modern date. And yet I should be guilty of a
gross omission were I to neglect giving you an account, however
superficial, of the remains of an apparently CASTELLATED BUILDING,
a little beyond the Abbaye aux Dames--or rather to the right, upon
elevated ground, as you enter the town by the way we came. As far
as I can discover, this appears to have escaped Ducarel.<A name=
"fnref_120"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_120">120</A> It is
doubtless a very curious relic. Running along the upper part of the
walls, there is a series of basso-relievo heads, medallion- wise,
cut in stone, evidently intended for portraits. They are assuredly
not older than the reign of Francis I. and may be even as late as
that of Henry II. Among these rude medallions, is a female head,
with a ferocious- looking man on each side of it, either saluting
the woman, or whispering in her ear. But the most striking objects
are the stone figures of two men, upon a circular tower, of which
one is in the act of shooting an arrow, and the other as if holding
a drawn sword. I got admittance within the building; and ascending
the tower, found that these were only the <EM>trunks</EM> of
figures,--and removable at pleasure. I could only stroke their
beards and shake their bodies a little, which was of course done
with impunity. Whether the present be the <EM>original</EM> place
of their destination may be very doubtful. The Abbé de la Rue, with
whom I discoursed upon the subject yesterday morning, is of opinion
that these figures are of the time of Louis XI.: which makes them a
little more ancient than the other ornaments of the building. As to
the interior, I could gather nothing with certainty of the original
character of the place from the present remains. The earth is piled
up, here and there, in artificial mounds covered with grass: and an
orchard, and rich pasture land (where I saw several women milking
cows) form the whole of the interior scenery. However the
<EM>Caennois</EM> are rather proud of this building.</P>

<P>Leaving you to your own conclusions respecting the date of its
erection, and &quot;putting the colophon&quot; to this disquisition
respecting the principal public buildings at Caen, it is high time
to assure you how faithfully I am always yours.</P>

LAMOUROUX. MEDAL OF MALHERBE. BOOKSELLERS. MEMOIR OF THE LATE M.
MOYSANT, PUBLIC LIBRARIAN. COURTS OF JUSTICE.</P>

<P>From the dead let me conduct you to the living. In other words,
prepare to receive some account of <EM>Society</EM>,--and of things
appertaining to the formation of the intellectual character. Caen
can boast of a public Literary Society, and of the publication of
its memoirs.<A name="fnref_121"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_121">121</A> But these &quot;memoirs&quot; consist at present
of only six volumes, and are in our own country extremely rare.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/236.png" alt="ABBÉ DE LA RUE">

<P class = "centered">ABBÉ DE LA RUE <BR>
Ætat. LXXIV.</P>
</DIV>

<P>Among the men whose moral character and literary reputation
throw a sort of lustre upon Caen, there is no one perhaps that
stands upon <EM>quite</EM> so lofty an eminence as the ABBÉ DE LA
RUE; at this time occupied in publishing a <EM>History of
Caen</EM>.<A name="fnref_122"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_122">122</A> As an archaeologist, he has no superior among his
countrymen; while his essays upon the <EM>Bayeux Tapestry</EM> and
the <EM>Anglo-Norman Poets</EM>, published in our
<EM>Archæologia</EM>, prove that there are few, even among
ourselves, who could have treated those interesting subjects with
more dexterity or better success. The Abbé is, in short, the great
archaeological oracle of Normandy. He was pleased to pay me a Visit
at Lagouelle&#39;s. He is fast advancing towards his seventieth
year. His figure is rather stout, and above the mean height: his
complexion is healthful, his eye brilliant, and a plentiful
quantity of waving white hair adds much to the expression of his
countenance.<A name="fnref_123"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_123">123</A> He enquired kindly after our mutual friend Mr.
Douce; of whose talents and character he spoke in a manner which
did equal honour to both. But he was inexorable, as
to--<EM>not</EM> dining with me; observing that his Order was
forbidden to dine in taverns. He gave me a list of places which I
ought to visit in my further progress through Normandy, and took
leave of me more abruptly than I could have wished. He rarely
visits Caen, although a great portion of his library is kept there:
his abode being chiefly in the country, at the residence of a
nobleman to whose son he was tutor. It is delightful to see a man,
of his venerable aspect and widely extended reputation, enjoying,
in the evening of life, (after braving such a tempest, in the
noon-day of it, as that of the Revolution) the calm, unimpaired
possession of his faculties, and the respect of the virtuous and
the wise.</P>

<P>The study of <EM>Natural History</EM> obtains pretty generally
at Caen; indeed they have an Academy in which this branch of
learning is expressly taught--and of which MONSIEUR LAMOUROUX<A
name="fnref_124"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_124">124</A> is at
once the chief ornament and instructor. This gentleman (to whom our
friend Mr. Dawson Turner furnished me with a letter of
introduction) has the most unaffected manners, and a countenance
particularly open and winning. He is &quot;a very dragon&quot; in
his pursuit. On my second call, I found him busied in unpacking
some baskets of seaweed, yet reeking with the briny moisture; and
which he handled and separated and classed with equal eagerness and
facility. The library of M. Lamouroux is quite a workman-like
library: filled with sensible, solid, and instructive books--and if
he had only accepted a repeated and strongly-pressed invitation to
dine with me at Lagouelle&#39;s, to meet his learned brother
PIERRE-AIMÉ LAIR, nothing would have been wanting to the completion
of his character!</P>

<P>You have just heard the name of Pierre-Aimé Lair. Prepare to
receive a sketch of the character to which that name appertains.
This gentleman is not only the life and soul of the society--but of
the very town--in which he moves. I walked with him, arm in arm,
more than once, through very many streets, passages, and courts,
which were distinguished for any relic of architectural antiquity.
He was recognised and saluted by nearly one person out of three, in
our progress. &quot;Je vous salue&quot;--&quot;vous voilà avec
Monsieur l&#39;Anglois&quot;--&quot;bon jour,&quot;--&quot;comment
ca va-t-il:&quot;--The activity of Pierre-Aimé Lair is only
equalled by his goodness of heart and friendliness of disposition.
He is all kindness. Call when you will, and ask for what you
please, the object solicited is sure to be granted. He never seems
to rise (and he is a very early riser) with spleen, ill-humour, or
untoward propensities. With him, the sun seems always to shine, and
the lark to tune her carol. And this cheerfulness of feeling is
carried by him into every abode however gloomy, and every society
however dull.</P>

<P>But more substantial praise belongs to this amiable man. Not
only is Pierre-Aimé Lair a lover and collector of tangible
antiquities--such as glazed tiles, broken busts, old pictures, and
fractured capitals--all seen in &quot;long array&quot;, up the
windings of his staircase--but he is a critic, and a patron of the
<EM>literary</EM> antiquities of his country. Caen (as I told you
in my last despatch) is the birth-place of MALHERBE; and, in the
character now under discussion, it has found a perpetuator of the
name and merits of the father of French verse. In the year 1806 our
worthy antiquary put forth a project for a general subscription
&quot;for a medal in honour of <EM>Malherbe</EM>,&quot;<A name=
"fnref_125"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_125">125</A> which
project was in due time rewarded by the names of <EM>fifteen
hundred</EM> efficient subscribers, at five francs a piece. The
proposal was doubtless flattering to the literary pride of the
French; and luckily the execution of it surpassed the expectations
of the subscribers. The head is undoubtedly of the most perfect
execution. Not only, however, did this head of Malherbe
succeed--but a feeling was expressed that it might be followed up
by a <EM>Series of Heads</EM> of the most illustrious, of both
sexes, in literature and the fine arts. The very hint was enough
for Lair: though I am not sure whether he be not the father of the
<EM>latter</EM> design also. Accordingly, there has appeared,
periodically, a set of heads of this description, in bronze or
other metal, as the purchaser pleases--which has reflected infinite
credit not only on the name of the projector of this scheme, but on
the present state of the fine arts in France.</P>

<P>Yet another word about Pierre-Aimé Lair. He is not so inexorable
as M. Lamouroux: for he <EM>has</EM> dined with me, and quaffed the
burgundy and champagne of Lagouelle, commander in chief of this
house. Better wines cannot be quaffed; and Malherbe and the Duke of
Wellington formed the alternate subjects of discourse and praise.
In return, I have dined with our guest. He had prepared an abundant
dinner, and a very select society: but although there was no wand,
as in the case of Sancho Panza, to charm away the dishes, &amp;c.
or to interdict the tasting of them, yet it was scarcely possible
to partake of one in four... so unmercifully were they steeped and
buried in <EM>butter!</EM> The principal topic of discourse, were
the merits of the poets of the respective countries of France and
England, from which I have reason to think that Pope, Thomson, and
Young, are among the greatest favourites with the French. The white
brandy of Pierre-Aimé Lair, introduced after dinner, is hardly to
be described for its strength and pungency. &quot;Vous n&#39;avez
rien comme ca chez vous?&quot; &quot;Je le crois bien, (I replied)
c&#39;est la liquéfaction même du feu.&quot; We broke up before
eight; each retiring to his respective avocations--but did not dine
till five. I borrowed, however, &quot;an hour or twain&quot; of the
evening, after the departure of the company, to enjoy the more
particular conversation of our host; and the more I saw and
conversed with him; the greater was my gratification. At parting,
he loaded me with a pile of pamphlets, of all sizes, of his own
publication; and I ventured to predict to him that he would
terminate his multifarious labours by settling into consolidated
BIBLIOMANIACISM. &quot;On peut faire pire!&quot;--was his reply--on
shaking hands with me, and telling me he should certainly meet me
again at <EM>Bayeux</EM>, in my progress through Normandy.<A name=
"fnref_126"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_126">126</A> My
acquaintance with this amiable man seemed to be my security from
insults in the streets.</P>

<P>Education here commences early, and with incitements as alluring
as at Rouen. POISSON in the <EM>Rue Froide</EM> is the principal,
and indeed a very excellent, printer; but BONNESERRE, in the same
street, has put forth a vastly pretty manual of infantine devotion,
in a brochure of eight pages, of which I send you the first, and
which you may compare with the specimen transmitted in a former
letter.<A name="fnref_127"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_127">127</A></P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:60%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/242.png" alt="Pater noster..."></DIV>

<P>Chapolin, in the <EM>Rue-Froide-Rue,</EM> has recently published
a most curious little manual, in the cursive secretary gothic,
entitled &quot;<EM>La Civilité honnête pour les enfans qui commence
par la maniere d&#39;apprendre et bien lire, prononcer et
écrire</EM>.&quot; I call it &quot;curious,&quot; because the very
first initial letter of the text, representing C, introduces us to
the <EM>bizarrerie</EM> of the early part of the XVIth century in
treatises of a similar character. Take this first letter, with a
specimen also of those to which it appertains.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/243.png" alt="Initial letter C"></DIV>

<P>This work is full of the old fashioned (and not a bit the worse
on that account) precepts of the same period; such as we see in the
various versions of the &quot;De Moribus Juvenum,&quot; of which
the &quot;<EM>Contenance de la Table,&quot;</EM> in the French
language, is probably the most popular. It is executed throughout
in the same small and smudged gothic character; and, as I conceive;
can have few purchasers. The printers of Caen must not be dismissed
without respectful mention of the typographical talents of LE ROY;
who ranks after Poisson. Let both these be considered as the Bulmer
and Bensley of the place.</P>

<P>But among these venders of infantine literature, or of cheap
popular pieces, there is no man who &quot;drives such a trade&quot;
as PICARD-GUERIN, <EM>Imprimeur en taille-douce et Fabricant
d&#39;Images</EM>,&quot; who lives in the <EM>Rue des
Teinturiers,</EM> no.175. I paid him more than one visit; as, from,
his &quot;fabrication,&quot; issue the thousands and tens of
thousands of broadsides, chap-books, &amp;c. &amp;c. which inundate
Lower Normandy. You give from <EM>one</EM> to <EM>three</EM> sous,
according as the subject be simple or compound, upon wood or upon
copper:--Saints, martyrs, and scriptural subjects; or heroes,
chieftains, and monarchs, including the Duke of Wellington and
Louis XVIII. le Désiré--are among the taille-douces specified in
the imprints. Madame did me the honour of shewing me some of her
choicest treasures, as her husband was from home. Up stairs was a
parcel of mirthful boys and girls, with painting brushes in their
hands, and saucers of various colours before them. Upon enquiry, I
found that they received four sous per dozen, for colouring; but I
will not take upon me to say that they were over or under paid--of
so <EM>equivocal</EM> a character were their performances. Only I
hoped to be excused if I preferred the plain to the coloured. In a
foreign country, our notice is attracted towards things perhaps the
most mean and minute. With this feeling, I examined carefully what
was put before me, and made a selection sufficient to shew that it
was the produce of French soil. Among the serious subjects were
<EM>two</EM> to which I paid particular attention. The one was a
metrical cantique of the <EM>Prodigal Son,</EM> with six wood cuts
above the text, exhibiting the leading points of the
Gospel-narrative. I will cut out and send you the <EM>second</EM>
of these six: in which you will clearly perceive the military turn
which seems to prevail throughout France in things the most minute.
The Prodigal is about to mount his horse and leave his father&#39;s
house, in the cloke and cock&#39;d hat of a French officer.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:70%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/245.png" alt="French officer"></DIV>

<P>The <EM>fourth</EM> of these cuts is droll enough. It is
entitled, &quot;<EM>L&#39;Enfant Prodigue est chassé par ses
maîtresses.&quot;</EM> The expulsion consists in the women driving
him out of doors with besoms and hair-brooms. It is very probable,
however, that all this character of absurdity attaches to some of
our own representations of the same subject; if, instead of
examining (as in Pope&#39;s time)</P>

<P class="poetry">... the walls of Bedlam and Soho,</P>

<P>we take a survey of the graphic broadsides which dangle from
strings upon the wall at Hyde Park Corner.</P>

<P>Another subject of a serious character, which I am about to
describe to you, can rarely, in all probability, be the production
of a London artist. It is called &quot;<EM>Notre-Dame de la bonne
Délivrande</EM>,&quot; and is necessarily confined to the religion
of the country. You have here, first of all, a reduced form of the
original: probably about one-third--and it is the more appropriate,
as it will serve to give you a very correct notion of the dressing
out of the figures of the VIRGIN and CHILD which are meant to grace
the altars of the chapels of the Virgin in most of the churches in
Normandy. Is it possible that one spark of devotion can be kindled
by the contemplation of an object so grotesque and so absurd in the
House of God?</P>

"SAINTE MARIE, MÈRE DE DIEU, priez pour nous."></DIV>

<P>To describe all the trumpery which is immediately around it, in
the original, would be a waste of time; but below are two good
figures to the right, and two wretched ones to the left. Beneath
the whole, is the following <EM>accredited</EM> consoling piece of
intelligence:</P>

<P class="quote">L&#39;AN 830, <EM>des Barbares descendent dans les
Gaules, massacrent les Fidèles, profanent et brûlent les Eglises.
Raoul, Duc de Normandie, se joint à eux; l&#39;image de la Ste.
Vierge demeure ensevelie sous les ruines de l&#39;ancienne chapelle
jusqu&#39;au règne de Henri I. l&#39;an 1331. Beaudouin, Baron de
Douvres, averti par son berger qu&#39;un mouton de son troupeau
fouillait toujours dans le même endroit, fit ouvrir la terre, et
trouva ce trésor caché depuis tant d&#39;années. Il fit porter
processionnellement cette sainte image dans l&#39;Eglise de
Douvres: mais Dieu permit qu&#39;elle fut transportée par un Ange
dans l&#39;endroit de la chapelle où elle est maintenant révérée.
C&#39;est dans cette chapelle que, par l&#39;intercession de Marie,
les pécheurs reçoivent leur conversion, les affligés leur
consolation, les infirmes la santé, les captifs leur delivrance,
que ceux qui sont en mer échappent aux tempêtes et au naufrage, et
que des miracles s&#39;opèrent journellement sur les pieux
Fidèles</EM>.</P>

<P>A word now for BIBLIOPOLISTS--including <EM>Bouquinistes</EM>,
or venders of &quot;old and second-hand books.&quot; The very
morning following my arrival in Caen, I walked to the abbey of St.
Stephen, before breakfast, and in the way thither stopped at a book
stall, to the right,--and purchased some black letter folios: among
which the French version of <EM>Caesar&#39;s Commentaries,</EM>
printed by Verard, in 1488, was the most desirable acquisition. It
is reserved for Lord Spencer&#39;s library;<A name=
"fnref_128"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_128">128</A> at a price
which, freight and duty included, cannot reach the sum of twelve
shillings of our money. Of venders of second hand and old books,
the elder and younger MANOURY take a decisive lead. The former
lives in the <EM>Rue Froide</EM>; the latter in the <EM>Rue Notre
Dame.</EM> The father boasts of having upwards of thirty thousand
volumes, but I much doubt whether his stock amount to one half of
that number. He unhesitatingly asked me two <EM>louis d&#39;or</EM>
for a copy of the <EM>Vaudevires</EM> of OLIVIER BASSELIN, which is
a modern, but privately printed, volume; and of which I hope to
give you some amusing particulars by and by. He also told me that
he had formerly sold a paper copy of <EM>Fust&#39;s Bible of
1462,</EM> with many of the illuminated initials cut out, to the
library of the Arsenal, at Paris, for 100 louis d&#39;or. I only
know that, if I had been librarian, he should not have had one half
the money.</P>

<P>Now for Manoury the younger. Old and young are comparative
terms: for be it known that the son is &quot;agé de soixante
ans.&quot; Over his door you read an ancient inscription, thus:</P>

<P class="poetry">&quot;<EM>Battu, percé, lié, Je veux changer de
main</EM>.&quot;</P>

<P>This implies either (like Aladdin&#39;s old lamps for new) that
he wishes to give new books in exchange for old ones, or that he
can smarten up old ones by binding, or otherwise, and give them a
renovated appearance. But the solution is immaterial: the
inscription being as above. The interior of the younger
Manoury&#39;s book repository almost appalled me. His front shop,
and a corridor communicating with the back part of the house, are
rank with moisture; and his books are consequently rotting apace.
Upon my making as pitiable a statement as I was able of this
melancholy state of things--and pleading with all my energies
against the inevitable destruction which threatened the dear
books--the obdurate bibliopolist displayed not one scintillation of
sympathy. He was absolutely indifferent to the whole concern. In
the back parlour, almost impervious to day-light, his daughter, and
a stout and handsome bourgeoise, with rather an unusually elevated
cauchoise, were regaling themselves with soup and herbs at dinner.
I hurried through, in my way to the upper regions, with apologies
for the intrusion; but was told that none were necessary--that I
might go where, and stay as long, as I pleased--and that any
explanation would be given to my interrogatories in the way of
business. I expressed my obligations for such civility; and gaining
an upper room, by the help of a chair, made a survey of its
contents. What piles of interminable rubbish! I selected, as the
only rational or desirable volume--half rotted with moisture--
<EM>Belon&#39;s Marine Fishes</EM>, 1551, 4to; and placing six
francs (the price demanded) upon the table, hurried back, through
this sable and dismal territory, with a sort of precipitancy
amounting to horrour. What struck me, as productive of a very
extraordinary effect--was the cheerfulness and <EM>gaieté de
coeur</EM> of these females, in the midst of this region of
darkness and desolation. Manoury told me that the Revolution had
deprived him of the opportunity of having the finest bookselling
stock in France! His own carelessness and utter apathy are likely
to prove yet more destructive enemies.</P>

<P>But let us touch a more &quot;spirit-stirring&quot; chord in the
book theme. Let us leave the <EM>Bouquiniste</EM> for the PUBLIC
LIBRARY: and I invite you most earnestly to accompany me thither,
and to hear matters of especial import. This library occupies the
upper part of a fine large stone building, devoted to the public
offices of government. The plan of the library is exceedingly
striking; in the shape of a cross. It measures one hundred and
thirty-four, by eighty, French feet; and is supposed, apparently
with justice, to contain 20,000 volumes. It is proportionably wide
and lofty. M. HÉBERT is the present chief librarian, having
succeeded the late M. Moysant, his uncle. Among the more eminent
benefactors and Bibliomaniacs, attached to this library, the name
of FRANCOIS MARTIN is singularly conspicuous. He was, from all
accounts, and especially from the information of M. Hébert, one of
the most raving of book-madmen: but he displayed, withal, a spirit
of kindness and liberality towards his favourite establishment at
Caen, which could not be easily shaken or subdued. He was also a
man of letters, and evinced that most commendable of all literary
propensities--a love of the LITERATURE OF HIS COUNTRY. He amassed a
very large collection of books, which was cruelly pillaged during
the Revolution; but the public library became possessed of a great
number of them. In those volumes, formerly belonging to him, which
are now seen, is the following printed inscription:
&quot;<EM>Franciscus Martin, Doctor Theologus Parisiensis,
comparavit. Oretur pro co</EM>.&quot; He was head of the convent of
Cordeliers, and Prefect of the Province: but his mode of collecting
was not always that which a public magistrate would call
<EM>legitimate</EM>. He sought books every where; and when he could
not <EM>buy</EM> them, or obtain them by fair means, he would
<EM>steal</EM> them, and carry them home in the sleeves of his
gown! He flourished about a century ago; and, with very few
exceptions, all the best conditioned books in the library belonged
to this magisterial book-robber. Among them I noted down with
singular satisfaction the Aldine edition of <EM>Stephanus de
Urbibus</EM>, 1502, folio--in its old vellum binding: seemly to the
eye, and comfortable to the touch. Nor did his copy of the
<EM>Repertorium Statutorum Ordinis Cartusiensis</EM>, printed by
<EM>Amerbach, at Basil</EM>, in a glorious gothic character, 1510,
folio, escape my especial notice--also the same Bibliomaniac&#39;s
beautiful copy of the <EM>Mentz Herbal</EM>, of 1484, in 4to.</P>

<P>But the obliquities of Martin assume a less questionable aspect,
when we contemplate a noble work, which he not only projected, but
left behind ready for publication. It is thus entitled: <EM>Athenæ
Normannorum veteres ac recentes, seu syllabus Auctorum qui oriundi
è Normannia, &amp;c.</EM> It consists of one volume, in MS., having
the authority of government, to publish it, prefixed. There is a
short Latin preface, by Martin, followed by two pages of Latin
verses beginning thus:</P>

<P class="poetry"><EM>In Auctorum Normannicorum Syllabum.<BR>
 <SPAN class="ind2">Prolusio metrica.</SPAN><BR>
 En Syllabus prodit palàm<BR>
 Contextus arte sedula<BR>
 Ex litteratæ Neustriæ<BR>
 Auctoribus celebribus.</EM><BR>
 <SPAN class="ind2">&amp;c. &amp;c.</SPAN></P>

<P>Among the men, the memories of whom throw a lustre upon Caen,<A
name="fnref_129"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_129">129</A> was
the famous SAMUEL BOCHART; at once a botanist, a scholar, and a
critic of distinguished celebrity. He was a native of Rouen, and
his books (many of them replete with valuable ms. notes) are among
the chief treasures of the public library, here. Indeed there is a
distinct catalogue of them, and the funds left by their illustrious
owner form the principal support of the library establishment.
Bochart&#39;s portrait, with those of many other benefactors to the
library, adorns the walls; suspended above the books: affording a
very agreeable coup-d&#39;oeil. Indeed the principal division of
the library, the further end of which commands a pleasant prospect,
is worthy of an establishment belonging to the capital of an
empire. The kindness of M. Hébert, and of his assistant, rendered
my frequent sojournings therein yet more delectable. The portrait
of his uncle, M. MOYSANT, is among the ornaments of the chief room.
Though Moysant was large of stature, his lungs were feeble, and his
constitution was delicate. At the age of nineteen, he was appointed
professor of grammar and rhetoric in the college of Lisieux. He
then went to Paris, and studied under Beau and Batteux; when,
applying himself more particularly to the profession of physic, he
returned to Caen, in his thirtieth year, and put on the cap of
Doctor of medicine; but he wanted either nerves or stamina for the
successful exercise of his profession. He had cured a patient,
after painful and laborious attention, of a very serious illness;
but his patient chose to take liberties too soon with his
convalescent state. He was imprudent: had a relapse; and was
hurried to his grave. Moysant took it seriously to heart, and gave
up his business in precipitancy and disgust. In fact, he was of too
sanguine and irritable a temperament for the display of that cool,
cautious, and patient conduct, which it behoveth all young
physicians to adopt, ere they can possibly hope to attain the
honours or the wealth of the <EM>Halfords</EM> and <EM>Matons</EM>
of the day! Our Moysant returned to the study of his beloved
belles-lettres. At that moment, luckily, the Society of the Jesuits
was suppressed; and he was called by the King, in 1763, to fill the
chair of Rhetoric in one of the finest establishments of that body
at Caen. He afterwards successively became perpetual Secretary of
the Academy of Sciences, and Vice-President of the Society of
Agriculture. He was next dubbed by the University, Dean of the
faculty of arts, and was selected to pronounce the public oration
upon the marriage of the unfortunate Louis XVI. with Marie
Antoinette. He was now a marked and distinguished public character.
The situation of PUBLIC LIBRARIAN was only wanting to render his
reputation complete, and <EM>that</EM> he instantly obtained upon
the death of his predecessor. With these occupations, he united
that of instructing the English (who were always in the habit of
visiting Caen,) in the French language; and he obtained, in return,
from some of his adult pupils, a pretty good notion of the laws and
liberties of Old England.</P>

<P>The Revolution now came on: when, like many of his respectable
brethren, he hailed it at first as the harbinger of national
reformation and prosperity. But he had soon reason to find that he
had been deceived. However, in the fervour of the moment, and upon
the suppression of the monastic and other public libraries, he
received a very wide and unqualified commission to search all the
libraries in the department of <EM>Calvados</EM>, and to bring home
to Caen all the treasures he might discover. He set forth upon this
mission with truly public spirited ideas: resolving (says his
nephew) to do for Normandy what Dugdale and Dodsworth had done for
England--and a <EM>Monasticum Neustriacum</EM> was the commendable
object of his ambition. He promised much, and perhaps did more than
he promised. His curious collection (exclusively of the cart-loads
of books which were sent to Caen) was shewn to his countrymen; but
the guillotine was now the order of the day--when Moysant
&quot;resolved to visit England, and submit to the English nobility
the plan of his work, as that nation always attached importance to
the preservation of the monuments, or literary materials, of the
middle ages.&quot;--He knew (continues the nephew) how proud the
English were of their descent from the Norman nobles, and it was
only to put them in possession of the means of preserving the
unquestionable proofs of their origin. Moysant accordingly came
over with his wife, and they were both quickly declared emigrants;
their return was interdicted; and our bibliomaniac learnt, with
heart-rending regret, that they had resolved upon the sale of the
national property in France. He was therefore to live by his wits;
having spiritedly declined all offer of assistance from the English
government. In this dilemma he published a work entitled
&quot;<EM>Bibliothèque des Ecrivains Français, ou choix des
meilleurs morceaux en prose et en vers, extraits de leurs
ouvrages</EM>,&quot;--a collection, which was formed with judgment,
and which was attended with complete success. The first edition was
in four octavo volumes, in 1800; the second, in six volumes 1803; a
third edition, I think, followed, with a pocket dictionary of the
English and French languages. It was during his stay amongst us
that he was deservedly admitted a member of the Society of
Antiquaries; but he returned to France in 1802, before the
appearance of the second edition of his <EM>Bibliothèque</EM>;
when, hawk-like, soaring or sailing in suspense between the
book-atmospheres of Paris and Caen, he settled within the latter
place--and again perched himself (at the united call of his
townsmen) upon the chair destined for the PUBLIC LIBRARIAN! It was
to give order, method, and freedom of access, to the enormous mass
of books, which the dissolution of the monastic libraries had
caused to be accumulated at Caen, that Moysant and his colleagues
now devoted themselves with an assiduity as heroic as it was
unintermitting. But the health of our generalissimo, which had been
impaired during his residence in England, began to give way beneath
such a pressure of fatigue and anxiety. Yet it pleased Providence
to prolong his life till towards the close of the year 1813: when
he had the satisfaction of viewing his folios, quartos, octavos,
and duodecimos, arranged in regular succession, and fair array;
when his work was honestly done; and when future visitors had only
to stretch forth their hands and gather the fruit which he had
placed within their reach. His death (we are told)<A name=
"fnref_130"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_130">130</A> was gentle,
and like unto sleep. Religion had consoled him in his latter
moments; and after having reposed upon its efficacy, he waited with
perfect composure for the breathing of his last sigh! Let the name
of MOYSANT be mentioned with the bibliomaniacal honours which, are
doubtless its due!...</P>

<P>From Librarians, revert we to books: to the books in the PUBLIC
LIBRARY of Caen. The oldest printed volume contained in it, and
which had been bound with a MS, on the supposition of its being a
manuscript also, is Numeister&#39;s impression of <EM>Aretinus de
Bella adversus Gothós</EM>, 1470, folio; the first book from the
press of the printer. I undeceived M. Hébert, who had supposed it
to be a MS. The lettering is covered with horn, and the book is
bound in boards; &quot;all proper.&quot; The oldest <EM>Latin
Bible</EM> they possess, is of the date of 1485; but there is
preserved one volume of Sweynheym and Pannartz&#39;s impression of
<EM>De Lyra&#39;s Commentary upon the Bible</EM>, of the date of
1471-2, which luckily contains the list of books printed by those
printers in their memorable supplicatory letter to Pope Sixtus IV.
The earliest Latin Classic appears to be the <EM>Juvenal</EM> of
1474, with the <EM>Commentary of Calderinus</EM>, printed at Rome;
unless a dateless impression of <EM>Lucan</EM>, in the earliest
type of Gering, with the verses placed at a considerable distance
from each other, claim chronological precedence. There is also a
<EM>Valerius Maximus</EM> of 1475, by Cæsaris and Stol, but without
their names. It is a large copy, soiled at the beginning. Of the
same date is Gering&#39;s impression of the <EM>Legenda
Sanctorum</EM>; and among the Fifteeners I almost coveted a very
elegant specimen of <EM>Jehan du Pré&#39;s</EM> printing (with a
device used by him never before seen by me,) of an edition of
<EM>La Vie des Peres</EM>, 1494, folio, in its original binding. I
collected, from the written catalogue, that they had only
FORTY-FIVE works printed in the FIFTEENTH CENTURY; and of these,
none were of first-rate quality.</P>

<P>Among the MSS., I was much struck with the beautiful penmanship
of a work, in three folio volumes, of the middle of the sixteenth
century, entitled; <EM>Divertissemens touchant le faict de la
guerre, extraits des livres de Polybe, Frontin, Vegece, Cornazzan,
Machiavel, et autres bons autheurs.&quot;</EM> It has no
illuminations, but the scription is beautiful. A <EM>Breviary of
the Church Service of Lisieux</EM>, of the fifteenth century, has
some pretty but common illuminations. It is not however free from
injury. Of more intrinsic worth is a MS. entitled <EM>Du
Costentin</EM>, (a district not far from Caen,) with the following
prefix in the hand-writing of Moysant. &quot;Ces mémoires sont de
M. Toustaint de Billy, curé du Mesnil au- parc, qui avoit travaillé
toute sa vie à l&#39;histoire du Cotentin. Ils sont rares et
m&#39;ont été accordes par M. Jourdan, Notaire, auquel ils
appartenoient. Le p. (Père) le Long et Mons. Teriet de fontette ne
les out pas connu. Moysantz.&quot; It is a small folio, in a neat
hand-writing. Another MS., or rather a compound of ms. and printed
leaves, of yet considerably more importance, in 3 folio volumes, is
entitled <EM>Le Moreri des Normans, par Joseph Andrié Guiat de
Rouen:</EM> on the reverse of the title, we read,
&quot;<EM>Supplément au Dictionnaire de Moreri pour ce qui concerne
la province de Normandie, et ses illustres</EM>.&quot; A short
preface follows; then an ode &quot;aux Grands Hommes de
Normandie.&quot; It is executed in the manner of a dictionary,
running in alphabetical order. The first volume extends to the
letter I, and is illustrated with scraps from newspapers, and a few
portraits. It is written pretty fully in double columns. The
portrait and biography of <EM>Bouzard</EM> form an admirable
specimen of biographical literary memoirs. The second volume goes
to Z. The third volume is entitled &quot;<EM>Les trois Siècles
palinodiques, ou Histoire Générale des Palinods de Rouen, Dieppe,
&amp;c.</EM>--by the same hand, with an equal quantity of matter.
It is right that such labours should be noticed, for the sake of
all future BLISS-like editors of provincial literature. There is
another similar work, in 2 folio ms. volumes, relating to
<EM>Coutance</EM>.</P>

<P>Before we again touch upon printed books, but of a later period,
it may be right to inform you that the treasures of this Library
suffered materially from the commotions of the Calvinists. Those
hot-headed interpreters of scripture destroyed every thing in the
shape of ornament or elegance attached to book-covers; and piles of
volumes, however sacred, or unexceptionable on the score of good
morals, were consigned to the fury of the flames. Of the remaining
volumes which I saw, take the following very rapid sketch. Of
<EM>Hours</EM>, or <EM>Church Services</EM>, there is a
prodigiously fine copy of an edition printed by <EM>Vostre</EM>, in
4to., upon paper, without date. It is in the original ornamented
cover, or binding, with a forest of rough edges to the leaves--and
doubtless the finest copy of the kind I ever saw. Compared with
this, how inferior, in every respect is a cropt copy of
<EM>Kerver&#39;s</EM> impression of a similar work, printed upon
vellum! This latter is indeed a very indifferent book; but the
rough usage it has met with is the sole cause of such inferiority.
I was well pleased with a fair, sound copy of the <EM>Speculum
Stultorum</EM>, in 4to., bl. letter, in hexameter and pentameter
verses, without date. Nor did I examine without interest a rare
little volume entitled &quot;<EM>Les Origines de quelques Coutumes
anciennes, et de plusieurs façons de parler triviales. Avec un
vieux Manuscrit en vers, touchant l&#39;Origine des Chevaliers
Bannerets</EM>; printed at Caen in 1672, 12mo.: a curious little
work. They have a fine (royal) copy of <EM>Walton&#39;s
Polyglot</EM>, with an excellent impression of the head; and a
large paper copy of <EM>Stephen&#39;s Greek Glossary</EM>; in old
vellum binding, with a great number of ms. notes by Bochart. Also a
fine large paper <EM>Photius</EM> of 1654, folio. But among their
LARGE PAPERS, few volumes tower with greater magnificence than do
the three folios of <EM>La Sainte Bible</EM>, printed by the
Elzevirs at Amsterdam, in 1669. They are absolutely fine creatures;
of the stateliest dimensions and most attractive forms. They also
pretend that their large paper copy of the first edition of
<EM>Huet&#39;s Praeparatio Evangelica</EM>, in folio, is unique.
Probably it is, as the author presented it to the Library himself.
The <EM>Basil Eustathius</EM> of 1559, in 3 volumes folio, is as
glorious a copy as is Mr. Grenville&#39;s of the Roman edition of
1542.<A name="fnref_131"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_131">131</A> It is in its pristine membranaceous attire--the
vellum lapping over the fore-edges, in the manner of Mr.
Heber&#39;s copy of the first Aldine Aristotle,--most comfortable
to behold! There is a fine large paper copy of <EM>Montaigne&#39;s
Essays</EM>, 1635, folio, containing two titles and a portrait of
the author. It is bound in red morocco, and considered by M. Hébert
a most rare and desirable book. Indeed I was told that one
Collector in particular was exceedingly anxious to obtain it. I saw
a fine copy of the folio edition of <EM>Ronsard</EM>, printed in
1584, which is considered rare. There is also a copy of the well
known <EM>Liber Nanceidos</EM>, from Bochart&#39;s library, with a
few ms. notes by Bochart himself. Here I saw, for the first time, a
French metrical version of the works of <EM>Virgil, by Robert and
Anthony Chevaliers d&#39;Agneaux freres, de Vire, en
Normandie</EM>; published at Paris in 1582, in elegant italic type;
considered rare. The same translators published a version of
Horace; but it is not here. You may remember that I made mention of
a certain work (in one of my late letters) called <EM>Les
Vaudevires d&#39;Olivier Basselin</EM>. They preserve here a very
choice copy of it, in 4to., large paper; and of which size only ten
copies are said to be in existence. The entire title is
&quot;<EM>Les Vaudevires Poesies du XVme. siècle, par Olivier
Basselin, avec un Discours sur sa Vie et des Notes pour
l&#39;explication de quelques anciens Mots: Vire, 1811</EM>.&quot;
8vo. There are copies upon pink paper, of which this is one--and
which was in fact presented to the Library by the Editors. Prefixed
to it, is an indifferent drawing, in india ink, representing the
old castle of Vire, now nearly demolished, with Basselin seated at
a table along with three of his boosing companions, chaunting his
verses &quot;à pleine gorge.&quot; This Basselin appears in short
to have been the French DRUNKEN BARNABY of his day.</P>

<P>&quot;What! (say you:) &quot;not <EM>one</EM> single specimen
from the library of your favourite DIANE DE POICTIERS? Can this be
possible?&quot;--No more of interrogatory, I beseech you: but
listen attentively and gratefully to the intelligence which you are
about to receive--and fancy not, if you have any respect for my
taste, that I have forgotten my favourite Diane de Poictiers. On
looking sharply about you, within this library, there will be found
a magnificent copy of the <EM>Commentaries of Chrysostom upon the
Epistles of St. Paul</EM>, printed by <EM>Stephanus et Fratres a
Sabio, at Verona</EM>, in 1529, in three folio volumes. It is by
much and by far the finest Greek work which I ever saw from the
<EM>Sabii</EM> Press.<A name="fnref_132"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_132">132</A> No wonder Colbert jumped with avidity to obtain
such a copy of it: for, bating that it is &quot;un peu rogné,&quot;
the condition and colour are quite enchanting. And then for the
binding!--which either Colbert, or his librarian Baluze, had the
good sense and good taste to leave <EM>untouched</EM>. The first
and second volumes are in reddish calf, with the royal arms in the
centre, and the half moon (in tarnished silver) beneath: the
arabesque ornaments, or surrounding border is in gilt. The edges
are gilt, stamped; flush with the fore edges of the binding. In the
centre of the sides of the binding, is a large H, with a fleur de
lis at top: the top and bottom borders presenting the usual D and
H, united, of which you may take a peep in the <EM>Bibliographical
Decameron.</EM> The third volume is in dark blue leather, with the
same side ornaments; and the title of the work, as with the
preceding volumes, is lettered in Greek capitals. The H and crown,
and monogram, as before; but the edges of the leaves are, in this
volume, stamped at bottom and top with an H, surmounted by a crown.
The sides of the binding are also fuller and richer than in the
preceding volumes. This magnificent copy was given to the Library
by P. Le Jeune. It is quite a treasure in its way.</P>

<P>Another specimen, if you please, from the library of our
favourite Diana. It is rather of a singular character: consisting
of a French version of that once extremely popular work (originally
published in the Latin language) called the <EM>Cosmography of
Sebastian Munster.</EM> The edition is of the date of 1556, in
folio. This copy must have been as splendid as it is yet curious.
It contains two portraits of Henry the Second (&quot;HENRICVS II.
GALLIARVM REX INVICTISS. PP.&quot;) and four of Holofernes
(&quot;OLOFARNE.&quot;) on each side of the binding. In the centre
of the sides we recognise the lunar ornaments of Diane de
Poictiers; but on the back, are five portraits of her, in gilt,
each within the bands--and, like all the other ornaments, much
rubbed. Two of these five heads are facing a different head of
Henry. There are also on the sides two pretty medallions of a
winged figure blowing a trumpet, and standing upon a chariot drawn
by four horses: there are also small fleur de lis scattered between
the ornaments of the sides of the binding. The date of the
medallion seems to be 1553. The copy is cruelly cropt, and the
volume is sufficiently badly printed; which makes it the more
surprising that such pains should have been taken with its
bibliopegistic embellishments. Upon the whole, this copy, for the
sake of its ornaments, is vehemently desirable.</P>

<P>And now, my dear friend, you must make your bow with me to M.
Hébert, and bid farewell to the PUBLIC LIBRARY at Caen. Indeed I am
fully disposed to bid farewell to every thing else in the same
town: not however without being conscious that very much, both of
what I have, and of what I have not, seen, merits a detail well
calculated to please the intellectual appetites of travellers. What
I have seen, has been indeed but summarily, and even superficially,
described; but I have done my best; and was fearful of exciting
ennui by a more parish-register-like description. For the service
performed in places of public worship, I can add nothing to my
Rouen details--except that there is here an agreeable PROTESTANT
CHURCH, of which M. MARTIN ROLLIN, is the Pastor. He has just
published a &quot;<EM>Mémoire Historique sur l&#39;Etat
Eclésiastique des Protestans François depuis François Ler
jusqu&#39;à Louis XVIII</EM>:&quot; in a pamphlet of some fourscore
pages. The task was equally delicate and difficult of execution;
but having read it, I am free to confess that M. Rollin has done
his work very neatly and very cleverly. I went in company with Mrs.
and Miss I---- to hear the author preach; for he is a young man
(about thirty) who draws his congregation as much from his talents
as a preacher, as from his moral worth as an individual. It was on
the occasion of several young ladies and gentlemen taking the
sacrament for the first time. The church is strictly, I believe,
according to the Geneva persuasion; but there was something so
comfortable, and to me so cheering, in the avowed doctrine of
Protestantism, that I accompanied my friends with alacrity to the
spot. Many English were present; for M. Rollin is deservedly a
favourite with our countrymen. The church, however, was scarcely
half filled. The interior is the most awkwardly adapted imaginable
to the purposes either of reading or of preaching: for it consists
of two aisles at right angles with each other. The desk and pulpit
are fixed in the receding angle of their junction; so that the
voice flies forth to the right and left immediately as it escapes
the preacher. After a very long, and a very tediously sung psalm,
M. Rollin commenced his discourse. He is an extemporaneous
preacher. His voice is sweet and clear, rather than sonorous and
impressive; and he is perhaps, occasionally, too metaphorical in
his composition. For the first time I heard the words &quot;<EM>Oh
Dieu!</EM>&quot; pronounced with great effect: but the sermon was
made up of better things than mere exclamations. M. Rollin was
frequently ingenious; logical, and convincing; and his address to
the young communicants, towards the close of his discourse, was
impressive and efficient. The young people were deeply touched by
his powerful appeal, and I believe each countenance was suffused
with tears. He guarded them against the dangers and temptations of
that world upon which they were about to enter, by setting before
them the consolations of the religion which they had professed, in
a manner which indicated that he had really their interests and
happiness at heart.</P>

<P>A word only about COURTS OF JUSTICE. &quot;A smack of the
whip&quot; will tingle in my ears through life;<A name=
"fnref_133"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_133">133</A> and I shall
always attend &quot;<EM>Nisi Prius</EM>&quot; exhibitions with more
than ordinary curiosity. I strolled one morning to the <EM>Place de
Justice</EM>--which is well situated, in an airy and respectable
neighbourhood. I saw two or three barristers, en pleine costume,
pretty nearly in the English fashion; walking quickly to and fro
with their clients, in the open air before the hall; and could not
help contrasting the quick eye and unconcerned expression of
countenance of the former, with the simple look and yet earnest
action of the latter. I entered the Hall, and, to my astonishment,
heard only a low muttering sound. Scarcely fifteen people were
present, I approached the bench; and what, think you, were the
intellectual objects upon which my eye alighted? Three Judges ...
all fast asleep! Five barristers, two of whom were nodding: one was
literally addressing <EM>the bench</EM> ... and the remaining two
were talking to their clients in the most unconcerned manner
imaginable. The entire effect, on my mind, was ridiculous in the
extreme. Far be it from me, however, to designate the foregoing as
a generally true picture of the administration of Justice at Caen.
I am induced to hope and believe that a place, so long celebrated
for the study of the law, yet continues occasionally to exhibit
proofs of that logic and eloquence for which it has been renowned
of old. I am willing to conclude that all the judges are not alike
somniferous; and that if the acuteness of our GIFFORDS, and the
rhetoric of our DENMANS, sometimes instruct and enliven the
audience, there will be found Judges to argue like GIBBS and to
decide like SCOTT.<A name="fnref_134"></A><A class="fnref" href=

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XIV.</H3>

<P>BAYEUX. CATHEDRAL. ORDINATION OF PRIESTS AND DEACONS. CRYPT OF
THE CATHEDRAL.</P>

<P><EM>Bayeux, May 16</EM>, 1818.</P>

<P>Two of the most gratifying days of my Tour have been spent at
this place. The Cathedral (one of the most ancient religious places
of worship in Normandy)<A name="fnref_135"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_135">135</A> has been paced with a reverential step, and
surveyed with a careful eye. That which scarcely warmed the blood
of Ducarel has made my heart beat with an increased action; and
although this town be even dreary, as well as thinly peopled, there
is that about it which, from associations of ideas, can never fail
to afford a lively interest to a British antiquary.</P>

<P>The Diligence brought me here from Caen in about two hours and a
half. The country, during the whole route, is open, well
cultivated, occasionally gently undulating, but generally denuded
of trees. Many pretty little churches, with delicate spires, peeped
out to the right and left during the journey; but the first view of
the CATHEDRAL of BAYEUX put all the others out of my recollection.
I was conveyed to the <EM>Hôtel de Luxembourg</EM>, the best inn in
the town, and for a wonder rather pleasantly situated. Mine hostess
is a smart, lively, and shrewd woman; perfectly mistress of the art
and craft of innkeeping, and seems to have never known sorrow or
disappointment. Knowing that Mr. Stothard, Jun. had, the preceding
year, been occupied in making a fac-simile of the &quot;famous
tapestry&quot; for our Society of Antiquaries, I enquired if mine
hostess had been acquainted with that gentleman:
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; &quot;je le connois bien; c&#39;est un brave
homme: il demeura tout près: aussi travailla-t-il comme quatre
diables!&quot; I will not disguise that this eulogy of our amiable
countryman<A name="fnref_136"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_136">136</A> pleased me &quot;right well&quot;--though I was
pretty sure that such language was the current (and to me somewhat
<EM>coarse</EM>) coin of compliment upon all occasions: and instead
of &quot;vin ordinaire&quot; I ordered, rather in a gay and
triumphant manner, &quot;une bouteille du vin de
Beaune&quot;--&quot;Ah! ça,&quot; (replied the lively landlady,)
&quot;vous le trouverez excellent, Monsieur, il n&#39;y a pas du
vin comme le vin de Beaune.&quot; Bespeaking my dinner, I strolled
towards the cathedral.</P>

<P>There is, in fact, no proper approach to this interesting
edifice. The western end is suffocated with houses. Here stands the
post-office; and with the most unsuspecting frankness, on the part
of the owner, I had permission to examine, with my own hands,
within doors, every letter--under the expectation that there were
some for myself. Nor was I disappointed. But you must come with me
to the cathedral: and of course we must enter together at the
western front. There are five porticos: the central one being
rather large, and the two, on either side, comparatively small.
Formerly, these were covered with sculptured figures and ornaments;
but the Calvinists in the sixteenth, and the Revolutionists in the
eighteenth century, have contrived to render their present aspect
mutilated and repulsive in the extreme. On entering, I was struck
with the two large transverse Norman arches which bestride the
area, or square, for the bases of the two towers. It is the boldest
and finest piece of masonry in the whole building. The interior
disappointed me. It is plain, solid, and divested of ornament. A
very large wooden crucifix is placed over the screen of the choir,
which has an effect--of its kind: but the monuments, and mural
ornaments, scarcely deserve mention. The richly ornamented arches,
on each side of the nave, springing from massive single pillars,
have rather an imposing effect: above them are Gothic ornaments of
a later period, but too thickly and injudiciously applied. Let me
now suppose that the dinner is over, and the &quot;vin de
Beaune&quot; approved of--and that on a second visit, immediately
afterwards, there is both time and inclination for a leisurely
survey. On looking up, upon entering, within the side aisle to the
left, you observe, with infinite regret, a dark and filthy green
tint indicative of premature decay--arising from the lead (of that
part of the roof,) having been stript for the purpose of making
bullets during the Revolution. The extreme length of the interior
is about 320 English feet, by 76 high, and the same number of feet
in width. The transepts are about 125 feet long, by 36 wide. The
western towers, to the very top of the spires, are about 250
English feet in height.</P>

<P>One of the most curious objects in the Cathedral, is the CRYPT;
of which, singularly enough, all knowledge had been long lost till
the year 1412. The circumstance of its discovery is told in the
following inscription, cut in the Gothic letter, upon a brass
plate, and placed just above the southern entrance:</P>

<P class="poetry"><EM>En lan mil quatre cens et douze<BR>

<P>It was my good fortune to visit this crypt at a very particular
juncture. The day after my arrival at Bayeux, there was a grand
<EM>Ordination</EM>. Before I had quitted my bed, I heard the
mellow and measured notes of human voices; and starting up, I saw
an almost interminable procession of priests, deacons, &amp;c.,
walking singly behind each other, in two lines, leaving a
considerable space between them. They walked bareheaded, chanting,
with a book in their hands; and bent their course towards the
cathedral. I dressed quickly; and, dispatching my breakfast with
equal promptitude, pursued the same route. On entering the western
doors, thrown wide open, I shall never forget the effect produced
by the crimson and blue draperies of the Norman women:--a great
number of whom were clustered, in groups, upon the top of the
screen, about the huge wooden crucifix;-- witnessing the office of
ordination going on below, in the choir. They seemed to be
suspended in the air; and considering the piece of sculpture around
which they appeared to gather themselves--with the elevation of the
screen itself--it was a combination of objects upon which the
pencil might have been exercised with the happiest possible result.
An ordination in a foreign country, and especially one upon such an
apparently extensive scale, was, to a professional man, not to be
slighted; and accordingly I determined upon making the most of the
spectacle before me. Looking accidentally down my favourite crypt,
I observed that some religious ceremony was going on there. The
northern grate, or entrance, being open, I descended a flight of
steps, and quickly became an inmate of this subterraneous abode.
The first object that struck me was, the warm glow of day light
which darted upon the broad pink cross of the surplice of an
officiating priest: a candle was burning upon the altar, on each
side of him: another priest, in a black vesture, officiated as an
assistant; and each, in turn, knelt, and bowed, and prayed ... to
the admiration of some few half dozen casual yet attentive
visitors--while the full sonorous chant, from the voices of upwards
of one hundred and fifty priests and deacons, from the choir above,
gave a peculiar sort of solemnity to the mysterious gloom
below.</P>

<P>I now ascended; and by the help of a chair, took a peep at the
ceremony through the intercolumniations of the choir: my
diffidence, or rather apprehension of refusal, having withheld me
from striving to gain admittance within the body. But my situation
was a singularly good one: opposite the altar. I looked, and beheld
this vast clerical congregation at times kneeling, or standing, or
sitting: partially, or wholly: while the swell of their voices,
accompanied by the full intonations of the organ, and the yet more
penetrating notes of the <EM>serpent</EM>, seemed to breathe more
than earthly solemnity around. The ceremony had now continued full
two hours; when, in the midst of the most impressive part of it,
and while the young candidates for ordination were prostrate before
the high altar (the diapason stop of the organ, as at Dieppe,<A
name="fnref_137"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_137">137</A>
sending forth the softest notes) the venerable Bishop placed the
glittering mitre (apparently covered with gold gauze) upon his
head, and with a large gilt crosier in his right hand, descended,
with a measured and majestic step, from the floor of the altar, and
proceeded to the execution of the more mysterious part of his
office. The candidates, with closed eyes, and outstretched hands,
were touched with the holy oil--and thus became consecrated. On
rising, each received a small piece of bread between the thumb and
forefinger, and the middle and third fingers; their hands being
pressed together--and, still with closed eyes, they retired behind
the high altar, where an officiating priest made use of the bread
to rub off the holy oil. The Bishop is an elderly man, about three
score and ten; he has the usual sallow tint of his countrymen, but
his eye, somewhat sunk or retired, beneath black and overhanging
eyebrows, is sharp and expressive. His whole mien has the
indication of a well-bred and well-educated gentleman. When he
descended with his full robes, crosier, and mitre, from the high
altar, me-thought I saw some of the venerable forms of our WYKEHAMS
and WAYNEFLETES of old-- commanding the respect, and receiving the
homage, of a grateful congregation! At the very moment my mind was
deeply occupied by the effects produced from this magnificent
spectacle, I strolled into <EM>Our Lady&#39;s Chapel</EM>, behind
the choir, and beheld a sight which converted seriousness into
surprise--bordering upon mirth. Above the altar of this remotely
situated chapel, stands the IMAGE OF THE VIRGIN with the infant
Jesus in her arms. This is the usual chief ornament of Our
Lady&#39;s Chapel. But what drapery for the mother of the sacred
child!--stiff, starch, rectangularly-folded, white muslin, stuck
about with diverse artificial flowers--like unto a shew figure in
Brook Green Fair! This ridiculous and most disgusting costume began
more particularly at Caudebec. Why is it persevered in? Why is it
endured? The French have a quick sensibility, and a lively
apprehension of what is beautiful and brilliant in the arts of
sculpture and painting ... but the terms &quot;joli,&quot;
&quot;gentil,&quot; and &quot;propre,&quot; are made use of, like
charity, to &quot;cover a multitude of sins&quot; ... or
aberrations from true taste. I scarcely stopped a minute in this
chapel, but proceeded to a side one, to the right, which yet
affords proof of its pristine splendour. It is covered with gold
and colours. Two or three supplicants were kneeling before the
crucifix, and appeared to be so absorbed in their devotions as to
be insensible of every surrounding object. To them, the particular
saint (I have forgotten the name) to whom the little chapel was
dedicated, seemed to be dearer and more interesting than the
general voice of &quot;praise and thanksgiving&quot; with which the
choir of the cathedral resounded. Before we quit the place you must
know that fourscore candidates were ordained: that there are sixty
clergy attached to the cathedral;<A name="fnref_138"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_138">138</A> and that upwards of four hundred
thousand souls are under the spiritual cognizance of the BISHOP OF
BAYEUX. The treasures of the Cathedral were once excessive,<A name=
"fnref_139"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_139">139</A> and the
episcopal stipend proportionably large: but, of late years, things
are sadly changed. The Calvinists, in the sixteenth century, began
the work of havoc and destruction; and the Revolutionists in the
eighteenth, as usual, put the finish to these devastations. At
present, from a very respectable source of information, I learn
that the revenues of the Bishop scarcely exceed 700<EM>l</EM>. per
annum of our own money. I cannot take leave of the cathedral
without commending, in strong terms of admiration, the lofty flying
buttresses of the exterior of the nave. The perpendicular portions
are crowned with a sculptured whole length figure, from which the
semi-arch takes its spring; and are in much more elegant taste than
any other part of the building.</P>

<P>Hard by the cathedral stood formerly a magnificent EPISCOPAL
PALACE. Upon this palace the old writers dearly loved to expatiate.
There is now however nothing but a good large comfortable family
mansion; sufficient for the purposes of such hospitality and
entertainment as the episcopal revenues will afford. I have not
only seen, but visited, this episcopal residence. In other words,
my friend Pierre-Aimé Lair having promised to take his last adieu
of me at Bayeux, as he had business with the Bishop, I met him
agreeably to appointment at the palace; but his host, with a strong
corps of visitors, having just sate down to dinner--it was only one
o&#39;clock--I bade him adieu, with the hope of seeing the Bishop
on the morrow--to whom he had indeed mentioned my name. Our
farewell was undoubtedly warm and sincere. He had volunteered a
thousand acts of kindness towards me without any possible motive of
self interest; and as he lifted up his right hand, exclaiming
&quot;adieu, pour toujours!&quot; I will not dissemble that I was
sensibly affected by the touching manner in which it was uttered
... and PIERRE AIMÉ LAIR shall always claim from me the warmest
wishes for his prosperity and happiness.<A name="fnref_140"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_140">140</A> I hurried back through the
court-yard--at the risk of losing a limb from the ferocious spring
of a tremendous (chained) mastiff-- and without returning the
salute of the porter, shut the gate violently, and departed. For
five minutes, pacing the south side of the cathedral, I was lost in
a variety of painful sensations. How was I to see the
LIBRARY?--where could I obtain a glimpse of the TAPESTRY?--and now,
that Pierre Aimé Lair was to be no more seen, (for he told me he
should quit the place on that same evening) who was to stand my
friend, and smooth my access to the more curious and coveted
objects of antiquity?</P>

<P>Thus absorbed in a variety of contending reflections, a tall
figure, clad in a loose long great coat, in a very gracious manner
approached and addressed me. &quot;Your name, Sir, is D----?&quot;
&quot;At your service, Sir, that is my name.&quot; &quot;You were
yesterday evening at Monsieur Pluquet&#39;s, purchasing
books?&quot; &quot;I was, Sir.&quot; &quot;It seems you are very
fond of old books, and especially of those in the French and Latin
languages?&quot; &quot;I am fond of old books generally; but I now
seek more particularly those in your language-- and have been
delighted with an illuminated, and apparently coeval, MS. of the
poetry of your famous OLIVIER BASSELIN, which...&quot; &quot;You
saw it, Sir, at Monsieur Pluquet&#39;s. It belonged to a common
friend of us both. He thinks it worth...&quot; &quot;He asks
<EM>ten louis d&#39;or</EM> for it, and he shall have them with all
my heart.&quot; &quot;Sir, I know he will never part with it even
for that large sum.&quot; I smiled, as he pronounced the word
&quot;large.&quot; &quot;Do me the honour, Sir, of visiting my
obscure dwelling, in the country--a short league from hence. My
abode is humble: in the midst of an orchard, which my father
planted: but I possess a few books, some of them curious, and
should like to <EM>read</EM> double the number I
<EM>possess</EM>.&quot; I thanked the stranger for his polite
attention and gracious offer, which I accepted readily....
&quot;This evening, Sir, if you please.&quot; &quot;With all my
heart, this very evening. But tell me, Sir, how can I obtain a
sight of the CHAPTER LIBRARY, and of the famous TAPESTRY?&quot;
&quot;Speak softly, (resumed the unknown) for I am watched in this
place. You shall see both--but must not say that Monsieur ---- was
your adviser or friend. For the present, farewell. I shall expect
you in the evening.&quot; We took leave; and I returned hastily to
the inn, to tell my adventures to my companion.</P>

<P>There is something so charmingly mysterious in this little
anecdote, that I would not for the world add a syllable of
explanation. Leaving you, therefore, in full possession of it, to
turn and twist it as you please, consider me as usual, Yours.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XV.</H3>

<P>VISIT NEAR ST. LOUP. M. PLUQUET, APOTHECARY AND BOOK-VENDER.
VISIT TO THE BISHOP. THE CHAPTER LIBRARY. DESCRIPTION OF THE BAYEUX
TAPESTRY. TRADE AND MANUFACTURE.</P>

<P>Well, my good friend! the stranger has been visited: his library
inspected: his services accepted: and his character partly
unfolded. To this I must add, in the joy of my heart, (as indeed I
mentioned slightly in my last) that both the Chapter LIBRARY and
the famous TAPESTRY have been explored and examined in a manner, I
trust, worthy of British curiosity. I hardly know what sort of
order to adopt in this my second and last epistle from Bayeux;
which will be semi-bibliomaniacal and semi-archaeological: and sit
down, almost at random, to impart such intelligence as my journal
and my memory supply.</P>

<P>The last was almost a purely <EM>ecclesiastical</EM> dispatch:
as I generally first take off my cap to the towers and turrets of a
cathedral. Now then for THE STRANGER! ... for it would be cruel to
prolong the agony of expectation. Mr. Lewis having occupied
himself, almost exclusively, with his pencil during the whole
morning, I persuaded him to accompany me to <EM>St. Loup</EM>.
After dinner we set out upon our expedition. It had rained in the
interim, and every tree was charged with moisture as we passed them
... their blossoms exhaling sweets of the most pungent fragrance.
The road ran in a straight line from the west front of the
cathedral, which, on turning round, as we saw it irradiated by
partial glimpses of sunshine, between masses of dark clouds,
assumed a very imposing and venerable aspect. I should tell you,
however, that the obliging Monsieur ---- came himself to the Hôtel
de Luxembourg, to conduct us to his humble abode: for
&quot;humble&quot; it is in every sense of the word. About
two-thirds of the way thither, we passed the little church of
<EM>St. Loup</EM>: a perfect Gothic toy of the XIIth century--with
the prettiest, best-proportioned tower that can be imagined.<A
name="fnref_141"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_141">141</A> It has
a few slight clustered columns at the four angles, but its height
and breadth are truly pigmy. The stone is of a whitish grey. We did
not enter; and with difficulty could trace our way to examine the
exterior through the high grass of the church yard, yet
<EM>laid</EM> with the heavy rain. What a gem would the pencil of
BLORE make of this tiny, ancient, interesting edifice! At length we
struck off, down a lane slippery with moisture--when, opening a
large swinging gate--&quot;here (exclaimed our guide)--lived and
died my father, and here his son hopes to live and die also.
Gentlemen, yonder is my hermitage.&quot; It was a retirement of the
most secluded kind: absolutely surrounded by trees, shrubs, hay-
stacks, and corn-stacks--for Monsieur ---- hath a fancy for farming
as well as for reading. The stair-case, though constructed of good
hard Norman stone, was much worn in the middle from the frequent
tread of half a century. It was also fatiguingly steep, but luckily
it was short. We followed our guide to the left, where, passing
through one boudoir-like apartment, strewn with books and papers,
and hung with a parcel of mean ornaments called <EM>pictures</EM>,
we entered a second--of which portions of the wainscoat were taken
away, to shew the books which were deposited behind. Row after row,
and pile upon pile, struck my wondering eye. Anon, a closet was
opened--and there again they were stowed, &quot;thick and
threefold.&quot; A few small busts, and fractured vases, were meant
to grace a table in the centre of the room. Of the books, it is but
justice to say that <EM>rarity</EM> had been sacrificed to
<EM>utility</EM>. There were some excellent, choice, critical
works; a good deal of Latin; some Greek, and a sprinkle of
Hebrew--for Monsieur ---- is both a general and a sound scholar. On
pointing to <EM>Houbigant&#39;s Hebrew Bible</EM>, in four folio
volumes, 1753, &quot;do you think this copy dear at fourteen
francs?&quot; said he!--&quot;How, Sir,&quot; (replied I, in an
exstacy of astonishment)--you mean to say fourteen
<EM>louis</EM>?&quot; &quot;Not at all, Sir. I purchased it at the
price just mentioned, nor do I think it too dear at that
sum&quot;--resumed he, in the most unsuspecting manner. I then told
him, as a sort of balsamic consolation, that a late friend (I
alluded to poor Mr. Ormerod) rejoiced on giving £12. for a copy by
no means superior. &quot;Ah, le bon Dieu!....&quot; was his only
observation thereupon.</P>

<P>When about to return to the boudoir, through which we had
entered, I observed with mingled surprise and pleasure, the four
prettily executed English prints, after the drawings of the present
Lady Spencer, called &quot;<EM>New Shoes&quot;--&quot;Nice
Supper</EM>&quot; &amp;c. Monsieur ---- was pleased at my stopping
to survey them. &quot;Ce sont là, Monsieur (observed he), les dames
qui me font toujours compagnie:&quot;--nor can you conceive the
very soft and gentlemanly manner, accompanied by a voice subdued
even to sadness of tone, with which he made this, and almost every
observation. I found, indeed, from the whole tenor of his
discourse, that he had a mind in no ordinary a state of
cultivation: and on observing that a great portion of his library
was THEOLOGICAL, I asked him respecting the general subjects upon
which he thought and wrote. He caught hold of my left arm, and
stooping (for he is much taller than myself, ... which he easily
may be, methinks I hear you add...) &quot;Sir, said he, I am by
profession a clergyman ... although now I am designated as an
<EM>ex-Curé</EM>. I have lived through the Revolution ... and may
have partaken of some of its irregularities, rather, I should hope
than of its atrocities. In the general hue-and-cry for reform, I
thought that our church was capable of very great improvement, and
I think so still. The part I took was influenced by conscientious
motives, rather than by a blind and vehement love of reform;... but
it has never been forgiven or forgotten. The established clergy of
the place do not associate with me; but I care not a farthing for
that--since I have here (pointing to his books) the very best
society in the world. It was from the persuasion of the clergy
having a constantly-fixed eye upon me, that I told you I was
watched ... when walking near the precincts of the cathedral. I had
been seeking you during the whole of the office of
ordination.&quot; In reply to my question about his
<EM>archaeological</EM> researches, he said he was then occupied in
writing a disquisition upon the <EM>Bayeux Tapestry</EM>, in which
he should prove that the Abbé de la Rue was wrong in considering it
as a performance of the XIIth century. &quot;He is your great
antiquarian oracle&quot;--observed I. &quot;He has an over-rated
reputation&quot;--replied he--&quot;and besides, he is too
hypothetical.&quot; Monsieur ---- promised to send me a copy of his
dissertation, when printed; and then let our friend N---- be judge
&quot;in the matter of the Bayeux Tapestry.&quot; From the open
windows of this hermitage, into which the branches absolutely
thrust themselves, I essayed, but in vain, to survey the
surrounding country; and concluded a visit of nearly two hours, in
a manner the most gratifying imaginable to honest feelings. A
melancholy, mysterious air, seemed yet, however, to mark this
amiable stranger, which had not been quite cleared up by the
account he had given of himself. &quot;Be assured (said he, at
parting) that I will see you again, and that every facility shall
be afforded you in the examination of the Bayeux Tapestry. I have
an uncle who is an efficient member of the corporation.&quot;</P>

<P>On my way homeward from this ramble, I called again upon M.
Pluquet, an apothecary by profession, but a book lover and a book
vender<A name="fnref_142"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_142">142</A> in his heart. The scene was rather singular.
Below, was his <EM>Pharmacopeia</EM>; above were his bed-room and
books; with a broken antique or two, in the court-yard, and in the
passage leading to it. My first visit had been hasty, and only as a
whetter to the second. Yet I contrived to see from a visitor, who
was present, the desirable MS. of the vulgar poetry of OLIVIER
BASSELIN, of which I made mention to M.----. The same stranger was
again present. We all quietly left the drugs below for drugs of a
different description above--books being called by the ancients,
you know, the &quot;MEDICINE OF THE SOUL.&quot; We mounted into the
bed-room. M. Pluquet now opened his bibliomaniacal battery upon us.
&quot;Gentlemen you see, in this room, all the treasures in the
world I possess: my wife--my child--my books--my antiquities.
&quot;Yes, gentlemen, these are my treasures. I am enthusiastic,
even to madness, in the respective pursuits into which the latter
branch out; but my means are slender--and my aversion to my
<EM>business</EM> is just about in proportion to my fondness for
<EM>books</EM>. Examine, gentlemen, and try your
fortunes.&quot;</P>

<P>I scarcely needed such a rhetorical incitement: but alas! the
treasures of M. Pluquet were not of a nature quite to make
one&#39;s fortune. I contrived, with great difficulty, to pick out
something of a <EM>recherché</EM> kind; and expended a napoleon
upon some scarce little grammatical tracts, chiefly Greek, printed
by Stephen at Paris, and by Hervagius at Basil: among the latter
was the <EM>Bellum grammaticale</EM> of E. Hessus. M. Pluquet
wondered at my rejecting the folios, and sticking so closely to the
duodecimos; but had he shewn me a good <EM>Verard Romance</EM> or a
<EM>Eustace Froissart</EM>, he would have found me as alert in
running away with the one as the other. I think he is really the
most enthusiastic book-lover I have ever seen: certainly as a
Bibliopolist. We concluded a very animated conversation on all
sides: and upon the whole, this was one of the most variously and
satisfactorily spent days of my &quot;voyage
bibliographique.&quot;</P>

<P>On the morrow, the mysterious and amiable M. ---- was with me
betimes. He said he had brought a <EM>basket of books</EM>, from
his hermitage, which he had left at a friend&#39;s house, and he
entreated me to come and examine them. In the mean while, I had had
not only a peep at the Tapestry, but an introduction to the mayor,
who is chief magistrate for life: a very Cæsar in miniature. He
received me stiffly, and appeared at first rather a priggish sort
of a gentleman; observing that &quot;my countryman, Mr. STOTHARD,<A
name="fnref_143"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_143">143</A> had
been already there for six months, upon the same errand, and what
could I want further?&quot; A short reply served to convince him
&quot;that it would be no abuse of an extended indulgence if he
would allow another English artist to make a fac-simile of a
different description, from a very small portion only.&quot;<A
name="fnref_144"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_144">144</A></P>

<P>I now called upon the Abbé Fétit, with a view to gain admission
to the <EM>Chapter Library</EM>, but he was from home--dining with
the Bishop. In consequence, I went to the palace, and wrote a note
in pencil to the Bishop at the porter&#39;s lodge, mentioning the
name of M. Lair, and the object of my visit. The porter observed
that they had just sat down to dinner--but would I call at three?
It seemed an age to that hour; but at length three o&#39;clock
came, and I was punctual to the minute. I was immediately admitted
into the premises, and even the large mastiff seemed to know that I
was not an unexpected visitor--for he neither growled, nor betrayed
any symptoms of uneasiness. In my way to the audience chamber I saw
the crosier and robes which the Bishop had worn the preceding day,
at the ceremony of ordination, lying picturesquely upon the table.
The audience chamber was rather elegant, adorned with Gobeleins
tapestry, quite fresh, and tolerably expressive: and while my eyes
were fastened upon two figures enacting the parts of an Arcadian
shepherd and shepherdess, a servant came in and announced the
approach of MONSEIGNEUR l&#39;EVEQUE. I rose in a trice to meet
him, between doubt and apprehension as to the result. The Bishop
entered with a sort of body-guard; being surrounded by six or seven
canons who had been dining with him, and who peeped at me over his
shoulder in a very significant manner. The flush of good cheer was
visible in their countenances--but for their Diocesan, I must say
that he is even more interesting on a familiar view. He wore a
close purple dress, buttoned down the middle from top to bottom. A
cross hung upon his breast. His countenance had lost nothing of its
expression by the absence of the mitre, and he was gracious even to
loquacity. I am willing to hope that I was equally prudent and
brief in the specification of the object I had in view. My request
was as promptly as it was courteously granted. &quot;You will
excuse my attending you in person; (said the Bishop) but I will
instantly send for the Abbé Fétit, who is our librarian; and who
will have nothing to do but to wait upon you, and facilitate your
researches.&quot; He then dispatched a messenger for the Abbé
Fétit, who quickly arrived with two more trotting after him--and
enlivened by the jingling music of the library keys, which were
dangling from the Abbé&#39;s fingers, I quickened my steps towards
the Chapter Library.</P>

<P>We were no sooner fairly within the library, than I requested my
chief conductor to give me a brief outline of its history.
&quot;Willingly&quot; he replied. &quot;This library, the remains
of a magnificent collection, of from 30, to 40,000 volumes, was
originally placed in the Chapter-house, hard by. Look through the
window to your left, and you will observe the ruins of that
building. We have here about 5000 volumes: but the original
collection consisted of the united libraries of defunct, and even
of living, clergymen--for, during the revolution, the clergy,
residing both in town and country, conveyed their libraries to the
Chapter-house, as a protection against private pillage. Well! in
that same Chapter-house, the books, thus collected, were piled one
upon another, in layers, flat upon the floor-- reaching absolutely,
to the cieling ... and for ten long years not a creature ventured
to introduce a key into the library door. The windows also were
rigidly kept shut. At length the Revolutionists wanted lead for
musket balls, and they unroofed the chapter-house with their usual
dexterity. Down came the rain upon the poor books, in consequence;
and when M. Moysant received the orders of government to examine
this library, and to take away as many books as he wanted for the
public library at Caen ... he was absolutely horror-struck by the
obstacles which presented themselves. From the close confinement of
every door and window, for ten years, the rank and fetid odour
which issued, was intolerable. For a full fortnight every door and
window was left open for ventilation, ere M. Moysant could begin
his work of selection. He selected about 5000 volumes only; but the
infuriated Revolutionists, on his departure, wantonly plundered and
destroyed a prodigious number of the remainder ... &quot;et enfin
(concluded he) vous voyez, Monsieur, ce qu&#39;ils nous out
laissé.&quot; You will give me credit for having listened to every
word of such a tale.</P>

<P>The present library, which is on the first floor, is apparently
about twenty-five feet square. The Abbé made me observe the XIIIth.
volume of the <EM>Gallia Christiana</EM>,<A name="fnref_145"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_145">145</A> in boards, remarking that
&quot;it was of excessive rarity;&quot; but I doubt this. On
shewing me the famous volume of <EM>Sanctius</EM> or <EM>Sanches de
Matrimonio Sacramentario</EM>, 1607, folio, the Abbé
observed--&quot;that the author wrote it, standing with his bare
feet upon marble.&quot; I was well pleased with a pretty
<EM>illuminated ms. Missal</EM>, in a large thick quarto volume,
with borders and pictures in good condition; but did not fail to
commend right heartily the proper bibliomaniacal spirit of M. Fétit
in having kept concealed the second volume of <EM>Gering&#39;s
Latin Bible</EM>--being the first impression of the sacred text in
France--when M. Moysant came armed with full powers to carry off
what treasures he pleased. No one knows what has become of the
first volume, but this second is cruelly imperfect--it is otherwise
a fair copy. Upon the whole, although it is almost a matter of
<EM>conscience</EM>, as well as of character, with me, to examine
every thing in the shape of a library, and especially of a public
one, yet it must be admitted that the collection under
consideration is hardly worthy of a second visit: and accordingly I
took both a first and a final view of it.</P>

<P>From the Chapter I went to the COLLEGE LIBRARY. In other words,
there is a fine public school, or Lycée, or college, where a great
number of lads and young men are educated &quot;according to
art.&quot; The building is extensive and well-situated: the
play-ground is large and commodious; and there is a well-cultivated
garden &quot;tempting with forbidden fruit.&quot; Into this garden
I strolled in search of the President of the College, who was not
within doors. I found him in company with some of the masters, and
with several young men either playing, or about to play, at
skittles. On communicating the object of my visit, he granted me an
immediate passport to the library--&quot;mais, Monsieur, (added he)
ce n&#39;est rien: il y avoit autrefois <EM>quelque chose</EM>:
maintenant, ce n&#39;est qu&#39;un amas de livres très
communs.&quot; I thanked him, and accompanied the librarian to the
Library; who absolutely apologized all the way for the little
entertainment I should receive. There was indeed little enough. The
room may be about eighteen feet square. Of the books, a great
portion was in vellum bindings, in wretched condition. Here was
<EM>Jay&#39;s Polyglot</EM>, and the matrimonial <EM>Sanctius</EM>
again! There was a very respectable sprinkling of <EM>Spanish and
French Dictionaries</EM>; some few not wholly undesirable
<EM>Alduses</EM>; and the rare Louvain edition of <EM>Sir Thomas
More&#39;s Works</EM>, printed in 1566, folio.<A name=
"fnref_146"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_146">146</A> I saw too,
with horror-mingled regret, a frightfully imperfect copy of the
<EM>Service of Bayeux Cathedral</EM>, printed in the Gothic letter,
UPON VELLUM. But the great curiosity is a small brass or bronze
crucifix, about nine inches high, standing upon the mantlepiece;
very ancient, from the character of the crown, which savours of the
latter period of Roman art--and which is the only crown, bereft of
thorns, that I ever saw upon the head of our Saviour so
represented. The eyes appear to be formed of a bright brown glass.
Upon the whole, as this is not a book, nor a fragment of an old
illumination, I will say nothing more about its age. I was scarcely
three quarters of an hour in the library; but was fully sensible of
the politeness of my attendant, and of the truth of his prediction,
that I should receive little entertainment from an examination of
the books.</P>

<P>It is high time that you should be introduced in proper form to
the famous BAYEUX TAPESTRY. Know then, in as few words as possible,
that this celebrated piece of Tapestry represents chiefly the
INVASION OF ENGLAND by WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, and the subsequent
death of Harold at the battle of Hastings. It measures about 214
English feet in length, by about nineteen inches in width; and is
supposed to have been worked under the particular superintendance
and direction of Matilda, the wife of the Conqueror. It was
formerly exclusively kept and exhibited in the Cathedral; but it is
now justly retained in the Town Hall, and treasured as the most
precious relic among the archives of the city. There is indeed
every reason to consider it as one of the most valuable historical
monuments which France possesses. It has also given rise to a great
deal of archaeological discussion. Montfaucon, Ducarel, and De La
Rue, have come forward successively--but more especially the first
and last: and Montfaucon in particular has favoured the world with
copper-plate representations of the whole. Montfaucon&#39;s plates
are generally much too small: and the more enlarged ones are too
ornamental. It is right, first of all, that you should have an idea
how this piece of tapestry is preserved, or rolled up. You see it
here, therefore, precisely as it appears after the person who shews
it, takes off the cloth with which it is usually covered.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:60%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/297.png" alt="BAYEUX TAPESTRY"></DIV>

<P>The first portion of the needle-work, representing the embassy
of Harold, from Edward the Confessor to William Duke of Normandy,
is comparatively much defaced--that is to say, the stitches are
worn away, and little more than the ground, or fine close linen
cloth, remains. It is not far from the beginning--and where the
colour is fresh, and the stitches are, comparatively,
preserved--that you observe the PORTRAIT OF HAROLD.<A name=
"fnref_147"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_147">147</A></P>

<P>You are to understand that the stitches, if they may be so
called, are threads laid side by side--and bound down at intervals
by cross stitches, or fastenings--upon rather a fine linen cloth;
and that the parts intended to represent <EM>flesh</EM> are left
untouched by the needle. I obtained a few straggling shreds of the
<EM>worsted</EM> with which it is Worked. The colours are generally
a faded or bluish green, crimson, and pink. About the last five
feet of this extraordinary roll are in a yet more decayed and
imperfect state than the first portion. But the designer of the
subject, whoever he was, had an eye throughout to Roman art--as it
appeared in its later stages. The folds of the draperies, and the
proportions of the figures, are executed with this feeling.</P>

<P>I must observe that, both at top and at bottom of the principal
subject, there is a running allegorical ornament;<A name=
"fnref_148"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_148">148</A> of which I
will not incur the presumption to suppose myself a successful
interpreter. The constellations, and the symbols of agriculture and
of rural occupation, form the chief subjects of this running
ornament. All the inscriptions are executed in capital letters of
about an inch in length; and upon the whole, whether this
extraordinary and invaluable relic be of the latter end of the
XIth, or of the beginning or middle of the XIIth century<A name=
"fnref_149"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_149">149</A> seems to me
a matter of rather a secondary consideration. That it is at once
<EM>unique</EM> and important, must be considered as a position to
be neither doubted nor denied, I have learnt, even here, of what
importance this tapestry-roll was considered in the time of
Bonaparte&#39;s threatened invasion of our country: and that, after
displaying it at Paris for two or three months, to awaken the
curiosity and excite the love of conquest among the citizens, it
was conveyed to one or two <EM>sea-port</EM> towns, and exhibited
upon the stage as a most important <EM>materiel</EM> in dramatic
effect.<A name="fnref_150"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_150">150</A></P>

<P>I think you have now had a pretty good share of Bayeux
intelligence; only that I ought not to close my despatches without
a word or two relating to habits, manners, trade, and population.
This will scarcely occupy a page. The men and women here are
thoroughly Norman. Stout bodies, plump countenances, wooden shoes,
and the cauchoise--even to exceedingly <EM>tall copies</EM> of the
latter! The population may run hard upon ten thousand. The chief
articles of commerce are <EM>butter</EM> and <EM>lace</EM>. Of the
former, there are two sorts: one, delicate and well flavoured, is
made during winter and spring; put up into small pots, and carried
from hence in huge paniers, not only to all the immediately
adjacent parts of the country, but even to Paris--and is shipped in
large quantities for the colonies. They have made as much as
120,000 lb. weight each season; but <EM>Isigny</EM>, a neighbouring
village, is rather the chief place for its production. The other
sort of butter, which is eaten by the common people, and which in
fact is made throughout the whole of Lower Normandy, (the very
butter, in short, in which the huge <EM>alose</EM> was floating in
the pot of the lively cuisiniere at Duclair<A name=
"fnref_151"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_151">151</A>) is also
chiefly made at Isigny; but instead of a delicate tint, and a fine
flavour, it is very much the contrary: and the mode of making and
transporting it accords with its qualities. It is salted, and
packed in large pots, and even barrels, for the sake of
exportation; and not less than 50,000 lb. weight is made each week.
The whole profit arising from butter has been estimated at not less
than two millions of francs: add to which, the circulation of
specie kept up by the payment of the workmen, and the purchase of
salt. As to <EM>lace</EM>, there are scarcely fewer than three
thousand females constantly employed in the manufacture of that
article.</P>

<P>The mechanics here, at least some of them, are equally civil and
ingenious. In a shop, in the high or principal street, I saw an
active carpenter, who had lost the fore finger of his right hand,
hard at work--alternately whistling and singing--over a pretty
piece of ornamental furniture in wood. It was the full face of a
female, with closely curled hair over the forehead, surmounted by a
wreath of flowers, having side curls, necklace, and platted hair.
The whole was carved in beech, and the form and expression of the
countenance were equally correct and pleasing. This merry fellow
had a man or two under him, but he worked double tides, compared
with his dependants. I interrupted him singing a French air,
perfectly characteristic of the taste of his country. The title and
song were thus:</P>

<P class="poetry">TOU JOURS.</P>

<P class="poetry">TOUJOURS, toujours, je te serai fidèle;<BR>
 Disait Adolphe à chaque instant du jour;<BR>
 Toujours, toujours je t&#39;aimerai, ma belle,<BR>
 Je veux le dire aux échos d&#39;alentour;<BR>
 Je graverai sur l&#39;écorce d&#39;un hètre,<BR>
 Ce doux serment que le dieu des amours,<BR>
 Vient me dieter, en me faisant connaître;<BR>
 Que mon bonheur est de t&#39;aimer toujours. <EM>Bis</EM>.</P>

<P class="poetry">Toujours, toujours, lui répondit Adèle,<BR>
 Tu régneras dans le fond de mon coeur;<BR>
 Toujours, toujours, comme une tourterelle,<BR>
 Je promets bien t&#39;aimer avec ardeur;<BR>
 Je pense à toi quand le soleil se lève,<BR>
 J&#39;y pense encore à la tin de son cours;<BR>
 Dans le sommeil si quelquefois je reve,<BR>
 C&#39;est au bonheur de te chérir toujours.</P>

<P>He was a carver on wainscoat wood: and if I would give myself
&quot;la peine d&#39;entrer,&quot; he would shew me all sorts of
curiosities. I secured a favourable reception, by purchasing the
little ornament upon which he was at work--for a napoleon. I
followed the nimble mechanic (ci-devant a soldier in
Bonaparte&#39;s campaigns, from whence he dated the loss of his
finger) through a variety of intricate passages below and up
stairs; and saw, above, several excellently well finished pieces of
furniture, for drawers or clothes-presses, in wainscoat wood:--the
outsides of which were carved sometimes with clustered roses,
surrounding a pair of fond doves; or with representations of
Cupids, sheep, bows and arrows, and the various <EM>emblemata</EM>
of the tender passion. They would have reminded you of the old
pieces of furniture which you found in your grandfather&#39;s
mansion, upon taking possession of your estate: and indeed are of
themselves no despicable ornaments in their way. I was asked from
eight to twelve napoleons for one of these pieces of massive and
elaborately carved furniture, some six or seven feet in height.</P>

<P>In all other respects, this is a town deserving of greater
antiquarian research than appears to have been bestowed upon it;
and I cannot help thinking that its ancient ecclesiastical history
is more interesting than is generally imagined. In former days the
discipline and influence of its See seem to have been felt and
acknowledged throughout nearly the whole of Normandy. Adieu. In
imagination, the spires of COUTANCES CATHEDRAL begin to peep in the
horizon.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XVI.</H3>

<P>BAYEUX TO COUTANCES. ST. LO. THE CATHEDRAL OF COUTANCES.
ENVIRONS. AQUEDUCT. MARKET-DAY. PUBLIC LIBRARY. ESTABLISHMENT FOR
THE CLERGY.</P>

<P>I send you this despatch close to the very Cathedral, whose
spires, while yet at Bayeux, were already glimmering in the horizon
of my imagination. The journey hither has been in every respect the
most beautiful and interesting that I have experienced on
<EM>this</EM> side the Seine. I have seen something like undulating
pasture-lands, wooded hills, meandering streams, and well-peopled
villages; and an air of gaiety and cheerfulness, as well as the
charm of picturesque beauty, has accompanied me from one cathedral
to the other.</P>

<P>I left the <EM>Hôtel de Luxembourg</EM>, at Bayeux, in a hired
cabriolet with a pair of horses, about five in the afternoon,
pushing on, at a smart trot, for ST. LO: which latter place I
entered by moon-light. The road, as usual, was broad and bold, and
at times undulating; flanked by beech, elm, and fir. As I just
observed to you, I entered St. Lo by moon-light: the double towers
of the great cathedral-like looking church having a grand and even
romantic effect on approaching the town. An old castle, or rather a
mere round-tower relic of one, appeared to the left, upon entering
it. Passing the porch, or west end of the church, sometimes
descending, at others ascending--midst close streets and
overhanging roofs of houses, which cast a deep and solemn shadow,
so as to shut out the moon beams for several hundred yards--and
pursuing a winding route, I at length stopped at the door of the
principal hôtel--<EM>au Grand Coq!</EM> I laughed heartily when I
heard its name; for with the strictest adherence to truth the
adjective ought to have been <EM>petit!</EM></P>

<P>However, the beds seemed to be in good order, and the coffee,
with which I was quickly served, proved to be excellent. I strolled
out, on a <EM>reconnoissance</EM>, about half-past nine; but owing
to the deep shadows from the moon, arising from the narrowness of
the streets, I could make out nothing satisfactory of the locale.
The church, however, promised a rich treat on the morrow. As soon
as the morrow came, I betook myself to the church. It was Sunday
morning. The square, before the west front of the church, was the
rendezvous both of townsmen and countryfolks: but what was my
astonishment on observing in one corner of it, a quack doctor
vending powder for the effectual <EM>polishing of metals</EM>. He
had just beaten his drum, in order to collect his audience; and
having got a good assemblage, was full of the virtues of his
wares--which were pronounced to be also &quot;equally efficacious
for <EM>complaints in the stomach!</EM>&quot;</P>

<P>This man had been preceded, in the situation which he occupied,
by a rival charlatan, on horseback, with <EM>powders to kill
rats</EM>. The latter stood upon the same eminence, wearing a hat,
jacket, and trowsers, all white -- upon which were painted
<EM>black rats</EM> of every size and description; and in his
harangue to the populace he took care to tell them that the rats,
painted upon his dress, were <EM>exact portraits</EM> of those
which had been destroyed by means of his powders! This, too, on a
Sunday morning. But remember Dieppe.<A name="fnref_152"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_152">152</A></P>

<P>Having despatched my breakfast, I proceeded to survey the
church, from which the town takes its name. First, for the
exterior. The <EM>attached</EM> towers demand attention and
admiration. They are so slightly attached as to be almost separated
from the body or nave; forming something of that particular
character which obtains more decidedly at the cathedral of
Coutances. I am not sure whether this portion of the church at St.
Lo be not preferable, on the score of regularity and delicacy, to
the similar portion at this latter place. The west front is indeed
its chief beauty of exterior attraction; and it was once rendered
doubly interesting by a profusion of alto-rilievo statues, which
<EM>disappeared</EM> during the commotions of the revolution. You
ascend rather a lofty flight of steps to this entrance; and into
which the whole town seemed to be pouring the full tide of its
population. I suffered myself to be carried away along, with the
rest, and almost startled as I entered the nave.<A name=
"fnref_153"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_153">153</A> To the
left, is a horribly-painted statue of the Virgin, with the child in
her arms. The countenance is even as ugly, old, and repulsive, as
the colouring is most despicable. I never saw such a daub: and what
emotions, connected with tenderness of feeling, or ardour of
devotion, can the contemplation of such an object excite? Surely
the parish must have lost its wits, as well as its taste, to endure
such a monstrous exhibition of art.</P>

<P>As I advanced towards the choir, I took especial notice of the
very singular, and in my opinion very ugly, formation both of the
pillars and arches which sustain the roof. These pillars have
<EM>no capitals</EM>, and the arch springs from them in the most
abrupt manner. The arch itself is also very short and sharp
pointed; like the tops of lancet windows. This mode obtains pretty
generally here; but it should be noted that, in the right side
aisle, the pillars have capitals. There is something unusual also
in the row of pillars which spring up, flanking the choir, half way
between the walls of the choir and the outward wall of the church.
Nor am I sure that, destitute of a graceful, superadded arch, such
massive perpendicular lines have either meaning or effect. Whether
St. Lo were the <EM>first</EM> church upon which the architect, who
built both <EM>that</EM> and the cathedral at <EM>Coutances</EM>,
tried his talents--or whether, indeed, both churches be the effort
of the same hand--I cannot pretend to determine; but, both
outwardly and inwardly, these two churches have a strong
resemblance to each other. Like many other similar buildings in
France, the church of St. Lo is closely blocked up by surrounding
houses.</P>

<P>I prepared to leave St. Lo about mid-day, after agreeing for a
large heavy machine, with a stout pair of horses, to conduct me to
this place. There are some curious old houses near the inn, with
exterior ornaments like those of the XVIth century, in our own
country. But on quitting the town, in the road to Coutances,--after
you come to what are called the old castle walls, on passing the
outer gate--your eye is struck by rather an extraordinary
combination of objects. The town itself seems to be built upon a
rock. Above, below, every thing appears like huge scales of iron;
while, at the bottom, in a serpentine direction, runs the peaceful
and fruitful river <EM>Aure</EM>.<A name="fnref_154"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_154">154</A> The country immediately around
abounds in verdant pasture, and luxuriantly wooded heights. Upon
the whole, our sortie from St. Lo, beneath a bright blue sky and a
meridian sun, was extremely cheerful and gratifying.</P>

<P>A hard road (but bold and broad, as usual) soon convinced me of
the uncomfortableness of the conveyance; which, though roomy, and
of rather respectable appearance, wanted springs: but the
increasing beauty of the country, kept my attention perfectly
occupied, till the beautiful cathedral, of COUTANCES caught my
notice, on an elevated ground, to the left. The situation is truly
striking, gaze from what quarter you will. From that of St. Lo, the
immediate approach to the town is rendered very interesting from
the broad <EM>route royale</EM>, lined with birch, hazel, and
beech. The delicacy, or perhaps the peculiarity of the western
towers of the cathedral, struck me as singularly picturesque; while
the whole landscape was warmed by the full effulgence of an
unclouded sun, and animated by the increasing numbers and activity
of the <EM>paysannes</EM> and <EM>bourgeoises</EM> mingling in
their sabbath-walks. Their bright dark <EM>blues</EM> and
<EM>crimsons</EM> were put on upon the occasion; and nought but
peace, tranquillity, and fruitfulness seemed to prevail on all
sides. It was a scene wherein you might have placed Arcadian
shepherds--worthy of being copied-by the pencil of Claude.</P>

<P>We entered the town at a sharp trot. The postilion, flourishing
his whip, and causing its sound to re-echo through the principal
street, upon an ascent, drove to the chief inn, the <EM>Hôtel
d&#39;Angleterre</EM>, within about one hundred yards of the
cathedral. Vespers were just over; and I shall not readily forget
the rush and swarm of the clergy who were pouring out, from the
north door, and covering the street with one extensive black mass.
There could not have been fewer than two hundred young
Ecclesiastics--thus returning from vespers to their respective
homes; or rather to the College, or great clerical establishment,
in the neighbourhood. This College, which has suffered from
violence and neglect, through the revolution and Bonaparte&#39;s
dynasty, is now beginning to raise its head in a very distinguished
and commanding manner. It was a singular sight--to see such a crowd
of young men, wearing cocked hats, black robes, and black bands
with white edging! The women were all out in the streets; sitting
before their doors, or quietly lounging or walking. The afternoon
was indeed unusually serene.</P>

<P>I ordered a late dinner, and set out for the cathedral. It was
impossible to visit it at a more favorable moment. The congregation
had departed; and a fine warm sun darted its rays in every
surrounding direction. As I looked around, I could not fail to be
struck with the singular arrangement of the columns round the
choir: or rather of the double aisle between the choir and the
walls, as at St. Lo; but here yet more distinctly marked. For a
wonder, an <EM>unpainted</EM> Virgin and child in Our Lady&#39;s
chapel, behind the choir! There is nothing, I think, in the
interior of this church that merits particular notice and
commendation, except it be some beautifully- stained glass windows;
with the arms, however, of certain noble families, and the regal
arms (as at Bayeux) obliterated. There is a deep well in the north
transept, to supply the town with water in case of fire. The pulpit
is large and handsome; but not so magnificent as that at Bayeux.
The organ is comparatively small. Perhaps the thirteenth century is
a period sufficiently remote to assign for the completion of the
interior of this church, for I cannot subscribe to the hypothesis
of the Abbé de la Rue, that this edifice was probably erected by
Tancred King of Sicily at the end of the eleventh, or at the
beginning of the twelfth century.</P>

<P>The exterior of this Church is indeed its chief attraction.<A
name="fnref_155"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_155">155</A>
Unquestionably the style of architecture is very peculiar, and does
not, as far as I know, extend beyond St. Lo, in Normandy. My great
object was to mount upon the roof of the central tower, which is
octagonal, containing fine lofty lancet windows, and commanding
from its summit a magnificent panorama. Another story, one half the
height of the present erection from the roof of the nave, would put
a glorious finish to the central tower of NOTRE DAME at COUTANCES.
As I ascended this central tower, I digressed occasionally into the
lateral galleries along the aisles. To look down, was somewhat
terrific; but who could help bewailing the wretched, rotten,
green-tinted appearance of the roof of the north aisle?--which
arose here, as at Bayeux, from its being stripped of the lead
(during the Revolution) to make <EM>bullets</EM>--and from the
rain&#39;s penetrating the interior in consequence. As I continued
to ascend, I looked through the apertures to notice the fine
formation and almost magical erection of the lancet windows of the
western towers: and the higher I mounted, the more beautiful and
magical seemed to be that portion of the building. At length I
reached the summit; and concentrating myself a little, gazed
around.</P>

<P>The view was lovely beyond measure. Coutances lies within four
miles of the sea, so that to the west and south there appeared an
immense expanse of ocean. On the opposite points was an extensive
landscape, well-wooded, undulating, rich, and thickly studded with
farm-houses. <EM>Jersey</EM> appeared to the north-west, quite
encircled by the sea; and nearly to the south, stood out the bold
insulated little rock of <EM>Granville</EM>, defying the eternal
washing of the wave. Such a view is perhaps no where else to be
seen in Normandy; certainly not from any ecclesiastical edifice
with which I am acquainted. The sun was now declining apace, which
gave a wanner glow to the ocean, and a richer hue to the landscape.
It is impossible to particularize. All was exquisitely refreshing
and joyous. The heart beats with a fuller pulsation as the eye
darts over such an expansive and exhilarating scene! Spring was now
clad in her deepest-coloured vesture: and a prospect of a fine
summer and an abundant harvest infused additional delight into the
beholder. Immediately below, stood the insulated and respectable
mansion or Palace of <EM>the Bishop</EM>; in the midst of a formal
garden--begirt with yet more formally clipt hedges. As the Prelate
bore a good character, I took a pleasure in gazing upon the roof
which contained an inhabitant capable of administering so much good
to the community. In short, I shall always remember the view from
the top of the central tower of the cathedral of Coutances!</P>

<P>I quitted such a spot with reluctance; but time was flying away,
and the patience of the cuisinier at the Hôtel d&#39;Angleterre had
already been put somewhat to the test. In twenty minutes I sat down
to my dinner, in a bed- room, of which the furniture was chiefly of
green silk. The females, even in the humblest walks, have generally
fine names; and <EM>Victorina</EM> was that of the fille de chambre
at the Hôtel d&#39;Angleterre. After dinner I walked upon what may
be called the heights of Coutances; and a more delightful
evening&#39;s walk I never enjoyed. The women of every
description-- ladies, housekeepers, and servant maids--were all
abroad; either sitting upon benches, or standing in gossiping
groups, or straying in friendly pairs. The comeliness of the women
was remarkable; a certain freshness of tint, and prevalence of the
embonpoint, reminded me of those of our own country; and among the
latter, I startled--as I gazed upon a countenance which afforded
but too vivid a resemblance to that of a deceased relation!
Certainly the Norman women are no where more comely and interesting
than they are at Coutances.</P>

<P>The immediate environs of this place are beautiful and
interesting: visit them in what direction you please. But there is
nothing which so immediately strikes you as the remains of an
<EM>ancient Aqueduct</EM>; gothicised at the hither end, but with
three or four circular arches at the further extremity, where it
springs from the opposite banks. Fine as was yesterday, this day
has not been inferior to it. I was of course glad of an opportunity
of visiting the market, and of mingling with the country people.
The boulevards afforded an opportunity of accomplishing both these
objects. Corn is a great article of trade; and they have noble
granaries for depositing it. Apparently there is a great conflux of
people, and much business stirring. I quickly perceived, in the
midst of this ever-moving throng, my old friend the vender of
rat-destroying powders--busied in the exercise of his calling, and
covered with his usual vestment of white, spotted or painted with
black rats. He found plenty of hearers and plenty of purchasers.
All was animation and bustle. In the midst of it, a man came
forward to the edge of a bank--below which a great concourse was
assembled. He beat a drum, to announce that a packet boat, would
sail to Jersey in the course of the afternoon; but the people
seemed too intent upon their occupations and gambols to attend to
him. I sat upon a bench and read one of the little chap
books--<EM>Richard sans peur</EM>--which I had purchased the same
morning.</P>

<P>While absorbed in reflections upon the heterogeneous scene
before me-- and wishing, for some of my dearest friends in England
to be also spectators of it--the notes of an hand-organ more and
more distinctly stole upon my ear. They were soft; and even
pleasing notes. On looking round, I observed that the musician
preceded a person, who carried aloft a Virgin, with the infant
Jesus, in wax; and who, under such a sign, exhorted the multitude
to approach and buy his book-wares. I trust I was too thorough-bred
a <EM>Roxburgher</EM> to remain quiet on the bench: and accordingly
starting up, and extending two sous, I became the fortunate
purchaser of a little <EM>chap</EM> article--of which my friend
BERNARDO will for ever, I fear, envy me the possession! The vender
of the tome sang through his nose, as the organ warbled the

<P>The day was beginning to wear away fast, and I had not yet
accomplished the favourite and indispensable object of visiting the
PUBLIC LIBRARY. I made two unsuccessful attempts; but the third was
fortunate. I had no letter of introduction, and every body was
busied in receiving the visits of their country friends. I was much
indebted to the polite attention of a stranger: who accompanied me
to the house of the public librarian, his friend, who, not being at
home, undertook the office of shewing me the books. The room in
which they are contained--wholly detached--and indeed at a
considerable distance from the cathedral--is about sixty English
feet long, low, and rather narrow. It is absolutely crammed with
books, in the most shameful state of confusion. I saw, for the
first time in Normandy, and with absolute gladness of heart, a copy
of the <EM>Complutensian Polyglot Bible</EM>; of which the four
latter volumes, in vellum binding, were tall and good: the earlier
ones, in calf, not so desirable. For the first time too, since
treading Norman soil, I saw a tolerably good sprinkle of
<EM>Italian</EM> books. But the collection stands in dreadful need
of weeding. Indeed, this observation may apply to the greater
number of public collections throughout Normandy. I thanked my
attendant for his patient and truly friendly attention, and took my
leave.</P>

<P>In my way homewards, I stopped at M. Joubert&#39;s, the
principal bookseller, and &quot;beat about the bush&quot; for
bibliographical game. But my pursuit was not crowned with success.
M.J. told me, in reply to black-letter enquiries, that a Monsieur
A----, a stout burly man, whom he called &quot;un gros papa&quot;--
was in the habit of paying yearly visits from Jersey, for the
acquisition of the same black-letter treasures; and that he swept
away every thing in the shape of an ancient and <EM>equivocal</EM>
volume, in his annual rounds. I learnt pretty nearly the same thing
from Manoury at Caen. M. Joubert is a very sensible and respectable
man; and is not only &quot;<EM>Seul Imprimeur de Monseigneur
l&#39;Evêque&quot;</EM> (PIERRE DUPONT-POURSAT), but is in fact
almost the only bookseller worth consulting in the place. I bought
of him a copy of the <EM>Livre d&#39;Eglise ou Nouveau Paroissien à
l&#39;usage du Diocèse de Coutances</EM>, or the common prayer book
of the diocese. It is a very thick duodecimo, of 700 double
columned pages, printed in a clear, new, and extremely legible
character, upon paper of sufficiently good texture. It was bound in
sheepskin, and I gave only <EM>thirty sous</EM> for it new. How it
can be published at such a price, is beyond my conception. M.
Joubert told me that the compositor or workman received 20 francs
for setting up 36 pages, and that the paper was 12 francs per ream.
In our own country, such prices would be at least doubled.</P>

<P>It is impossible not to be struck here with the great number of
YOUNG ECCLESIASTICS. In short, the establishment now erecting for
them, will contain, when completed, (according to report) not fewer
than four hundred. It is also impossible not to be struck with the
extreme simplicity of their manners and deportment. They converse
with apparent familiarity with the very humblest of their flock:
and seem, from the highest to the lowest, to be cordially received.
They are indifferent as to personal appearance. One young man
carries a bundle of linen to his laundress, along the streets:
another carries a round hat in his hand, having a cocked one upon
his head: a kitchen utensil is seen in the hand of a third, and a
chair, or small table, in that of a fourth. As these Clergymen
pass, they are repeatedly saluted. Till the principal building be
finished, many of them are scattered about the town, living quite
in the upper stories. In short, it is the <EM>profession</EM>,
rather than the particular candidate, which seems to claim the
respectful attention of the townsmen.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XVII.</H3>

<P>JOURNEY TO GRANVILLE. GRANVILLE. VILLE DIEU. ST. SEVER. TOWN AND
CASTLE OF VIRE.</P>

<P><EM>Vire</EM>.</P>

<P>Since my last, I have been as much gratified by the charms of
nature and of art, as during any one period of my tour. Prepare,
therefore, for miscellaneous intelligence; but such as, I will make
bold to predict, cannot fail to afford you considerable
gratification. Normandy is doubtless a glorious country. It is
fruitful in its soil, picturesque in the disposition of its land
and water, and rich in the architectural relics of &quot;the olden
time.&quot; It is also more than ordinarily interesting to an
Englishman. Here, in the very town whence I transmit this
despatch--within two hundred and fifty yards of the hotel of the
<EM>Cheval Blanc</EM>, which just now encloses me within its
granite walls--here, I say, lived and revelled the illustrious
family of the DE VERES.<A name="fnref_157"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_157">157</A> Hence William the Conqueror took the famous
AUBREY DE VERE to be a spectator of his prowess, and a sharer of
his spoils, in his decisive subjugation of our own country. It is
from this place that the De Veres derive their name. Their
once-proud castle yet towers above the rushing rivulet below, which
turns a hundred mills in its course: but the warder&#39;s horn has
long ceased to be heard, and the ramparts are levelled with the
solid rock with which they were once, as it were, identified.</P>

<P>I left Coutances with something approaching to reluctance; so
completely <EM>anglicised</EM> seemed to be the scenery and
inhabitants. The evening was beautiful in the extreme: and upon
gaining the height of one of the opposite hills, within about half
a league of the town, on the high Granville route, I
alighted--walked, stopped, and gazed, alternately, upon the lovely
landscape around--the cathedral, in the mean time, becoming of one
entire golden tint from the radiance of the setting sun. It was
hardly possible to view a more perfect picture of its kind; and it
served as a just counterpart to the more expansive scene which I
had contemplated, but the preceding evening, from the heights of
that same cathedral. The conducteur of the Diligence rousing me
from my rapturous abstraction, I remounted, and descended into a
valley; and ere the succeeding height was gained, a fainter light
floated over the distant landscape ... and every object reminded me
of the accuracy of those exquisite lines of Collins-- descriptive
of the approach of evening&#39;s</P>

<P class="poetry">... gradual, dusky veil.</P>

<P>For the first time, I had to do with a drunken conducteur.
Luckily the road was broad, and in the finest possible condition,
and perfectly well known to the horses. Every turning was
successfully made; and the fear of upsetting began to give way to
the annoyance experienced from the roaring and shouting of the
conducteur. It was almost dark when I reached GRANVILLE--about
twelve miles from Coutances; when I learnt that the horses had run
six miles before they started with us. On entering the town, the
road was absolutely solid rock: and considering what a
<EM>house</EM> we carried behind us (for so the body of the
<EM>diligence</EM> seemed) and the uncertain footing of the horses,
in consequence of the rocky surface of the road, I apprehended the
most sinister result. Luckily it was moon-light; when, approaching
one of the sorriest looking inns imaginable, whither our conducteur
(in spite of the better instructions of the landlord of the Hôtel
d&#39;Angleterre at Coutances) had persuaded us to go, the
passengers alighted with thankful hearts, and bespoke supper and
beds.</P>

<P>Granville is fortified on the land side by a deep ravine, which
renders an approach from thence almost impracticable. On every
other side it is defended by the ocean, into which the town seems
to have dropt perpendicularly from the clouds. At high water,
Granville cannot be approached, even by transports, nearer than
within two-thirds of a league; and of course at low water it is
surrounded by an extent of sharply pointed rock and chalk:
impenetrable--terrific--and presenting both certain failure and
destruction to the assailants. It is a GIBRALTAR IN MINIATURE. The
English sharply cannonaded it a few years since, but it was only a
political diversion. No landing was attempted. In the time of the
civil wars, and more particularly in those of the League,
Granville, however, had its share of misery. It is now a quiet,
dull, dreary, place; to be visited only for the sake of the view
from thence, looking towards <EM>St. Malo</EM>, and <EM>Mont St.
Michel</EM>; the latter of which I give up--as an hopeless object
of attainment. Granville is in fact built upon rock;<A name=
"fnref_158"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_158">158</A> and the
houses and the only two churches are entirely constructed of
granite. The principal church (I think it was the principal) is
rather pretty within, as to its construction; but the decidedly
gloomy effect given to it by the tint of the <EM>granite</EM>--the
pillars being composed of that substance-- renders it disagreeable
to the eye. I saw several confessionals; and in one of them, the
office of confession was being performed by a priest, who attended
to two penitents at the same time; but whose physiognomy was so
repulsively frightful, that I could not help concluding he was
listening to a tale which he was by no means prepared to
receive.</P>

<P>An hour&#39;s examination of the town thoroughly satisfied me.
There was no public conveyance to <EM>Vire</EM>, whither I intended
immediately departing, and so I hired a voiture to be drawn by one
sturdy Norman horse. To a question about springs, the conducteur
replied that I should find every thing &quot;très propre.&quot;
Having paid the reckoning, I set my face towards VIRE. The day, for
the season of the year, turned out to be gloomy and cold beyond
measure: and the wind (to the east) was directly in my face.
Nevertheless the road was one of the finest that I had seen in
France, for breadth and general soundness of condition. It had all
the characteristics, in breadth and straitness, of a Roman route;
and as it was greatly undulating, I had frequently some gratifying
glimpses of its bold direction. The surrounding country was of a
quietly picturesque but fruitful aspect; and had my seat been
comfortable, or after the fashion of those in my own country, my
sensations had been more agreeable. But in truth, instead of
<EM>springs</EM>, or any thing approximating to &quot;très
propre,&quot; I had to encounter a <EM>hard plank</EM>, suspended
at the extremities, by a piece of leather, to the sides; and as the
road was but too well bottomed, and the conveyance was open in
front to the bitter blast of the east, I can hardly describe (as I
shall never forget) the misery of this conveyance.</P>

<P>Fortunately the first stage was <EM>Ville Dieu</EM>. Here I
ordered a voiture and post horses: but the master of the Poste
Royale, or rather of the inn, shook his head--&quot;Pour les
chevaux, vous en aurez des meilleurs: mais, pour la voiture il
n&#39;y en a pas. Tenez, Monsieur; venez voir.&quot; I followed,
with miserable forebodings--and entering a shed, where stood an old
tumble-down- looking phaeton--&quot;la voilà, c&#39;est la seule
que je possède en ce moment&quot;-- exclaimed the landlord. It had
never stirred from its position since the fall of last years&#39;
leaf. It had been--within and without--the roosting place for fowls
and other of the feathered tribe in the farm yard; and although
literally covered with the <EM>evidences</EM> of such long and
undisturbed possession, yet, as there was no appearance of rain,
and as I discovered the wished for &quot;<EM>ressorts</EM>&quot;
(or <EM>springs</EM>) I compromised for the repulsiveness of the
exterior, and declared my intention of taking it onward. Water,
brooms, brushes, and cloths, were quickly put in requisition; and
two stately and well fed horses, which threatened to fly away with
this slender machine, being fastened on, I absolutely darted
forward at a round rattling gallop for <EM>St. Sever</EM>.
Blessings ever wait upon the memory of that artisan who invented
... <EM>springs</EM>!</P>

<P>The postilion had the perfect command of his horses, and he
galloped, or trotted, or ambled, as his fancy--or rather our
wishes--directed. The approach to our halting place was rather
imposing. What seemed to be a monastery, or church, at St. Sever,
had quite the appearance of Moorish architecture; and indeed as I
had occasional glimpses of it through the trees, the effect was
exceedingly picturesque. This posting town is in truth very
delightfully situated. While the horses were being changed, I made
our way for the monastery; which I found to be in a state rather of
dilapidation than of ruin. It had, indeed, a wretched aspect. I
entered the chapel, and saw lying, transversely upon a desk, to the
left--a very clean, large paper, and uncut copy of the folio
<EM>Rouen Missal</EM> of 1759. Every thing about this deserted and
decaying spot had a melancholy appearance: but the surrounding
country was rich, wooded, and picturesque. In former days of
prosperity--such as St. Sever had seen before the Revolution--there
had been gaiety, abundance, and happiness. It was now a perfect
contrast to such a state.</P>

<P>On returning to the &quot;<EM>Poste Royale</EM>&quot; I found
two fresh lusty horses to our voiture--but the postilion had sent a
boy into the field to catch a <EM>third</EM>. Wherefore was this?
The tarif exacted it. A third horse &quot;réciproquement pour
l&#39;année&quot;--parce qu&#39;il faut traverser une grande
montagne avant d&#39;arriver à Vire&quot;--was the explanatory
reply. It seemed perfectly ridiculous, as the vehicle was of such
slender dimensions and weight. However, I was forced to yield. To
scold the postboy was equally absurd and unavailing: &quot;parce
que la tarif l&#39;exigea.&quot; But the &quot;montagne&quot; was
doubtless a reason for this additional horse: and I began to
imagine that something magnificently picturesque might be in store.
The three horses were put a-breast, and off we started with a
phaeton-like velocity! Certainly nothing could have a more
ridiculous appearance than my pigmy voiture thus conveyed by three
animals--strong enough to have drawn the diligence. I was not long
in reaching this &quot;huge mountain,&quot; which provoked my
unqualified laughter--from its insignificant size--and upon the top
of which stands the town of VIRE. It had been a <EM>fair</EM>-day;
and groups of men and women, returning from the town, in their blue
and crimson dresses, cheered somewhat the general gloom of the day,
and lighted up the features of the landscape. The nearer I
approached, the more numerous and incessant were these groups.</P>

<P>Vire is a sort of <EM>Rouen</EM> in miniature--if bustle and
population be only considered. In architectural comparison, it is
miserably feeble and inferior. The houses are generally built of
granite, and look extremely sombre in consequence. The old castle
is yet interesting and commanding. But of this presently. I drove
to the &quot;<EM>Cheval Blanc</EM>,&quot; and bespoke, as usual, a
late dinner and beds. The first visit was to the <EM>castle,</EM>
but it is right that you should know, before hand, that the town of
Vire, which contains a population of about ten thousand souls,
stands upon a commanding eminence, in the midst of a very beautiful
and picturesque country called the BOCAGE. This country was, in
former times, as fruitful in civil wars, horrors, and devastations,
as the more celebrated Bocage of the more western part of France
during the late Revolution. In short, the Bocage of Normandy was
the scene of bloodshed during the Calvinistic or Hugonot
persecution. It was in the vicinity of this town, in the parts
through which I have travelled--from Caen hitherwards--that the
hills and the dales rang with the feats of arms displayed in the
alternate discomfiture and success of COLIGNY, CONDÉ, MONTMOGERY,
and MATIGNON.<A name="fnref_159"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_159">159</A></P>

<P>But for the Castle. It is situated at the extremity of an open
space, terminated by a portion of the boulevards; having, in the
foreground, the public library to the left, and a sort of municipal
hall to the right: neither of them objects of much architectural
consequence. Still nearer in the foreground, is a fountain; whither
men, women, and children--but chiefly the second class, in the
character of <EM>blanchisseuses</EM>-- regularly resort for water;
as its bason is usually overflowing. It was in a lucky moment that
Mr. Lewis paid a visit to this spot; which his ready pencil
transmitted to his sketch-book in a manner too beautiful and
faithful not to be followed up by a finished design. I send you a
portion of this prettily grouped picture; premising, that the woman
to the right, in the foreground, begged leave purposely to sit--or
rather stand--for her portrait. The artist, in a short time, was
completely surrounded by spectators of his graphic skill.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/332.png" alt="Picture by Mr. Lewis"></DIV>

<P>The &quot;<EM>Cheval Blanc</EM>&quot;--the name of the hotel at
which I reside-- should be rather called the &quot;<EM>Cheval
Noir</EM>;&quot; for a more dark, dingy, and even dirty residence,
for a traveller of any <EM>nasal</EM> or <EM>ocular</EM>
sensibility, can be rarely visited. My bed room is hung with
tapestry; which, for aught I know to the contrary, may represent
the daring exploits of MONTGOMERY and MATIGNON: but which is so
begrimed with filth that there is no decyphering the subjects
worked upon it.</P>

<P>On leaving the inn--and making your way to the top of the
street--you turn to the left; but on looking down, again to the
left, you observe, below you, the great high road leading to
<EM>Caen</EM>, which has a noble appearance. Indeed, the manner in
which this part of Normandy is intersected with the
&quot;<EM>routes royales</EM>&quot; cannot fail to strike a
stranger; especially as these roads run over hill and dale, amidst
meadows, and orchards, equally abundant in their respective
harvests. The immediate vicinity of the town is as remarkable for
its picturesque objects of scenery as for its high state of
cultivation; and a stroll upon the heights, in whatever part
visited, will not fail to repay you for the certain disappointment
to be experienced within the streets of the town. Portions of the
scenery, from these heights, are not unlike those in Derbyshire,
about Matlock. There is plenty of rock, of shrubs, and of fern;
while another <EM>Derwent</EM>, less turbid and muddy, meanders
below. Thus much for a general, but hasty sketch of the town of
Vire. My next shall give you some detail of the <EM>interior</EM>
of a few of the houses, of which I may be said to have hitherto
only contemplated the <EM>roofs</EM>.</P>

<P>And yet I must not close my despatch without performing my
promise about the CASTLE; of which indeed (as you will see by the
subjoined miniature view) only a sort of ruinous shell remains. Its
age may be a little towards the end of the thirteenth century. The
stone is of a deep reddish tint: and although what remains is only
a portion of the <EM>keep</EM>, yet I can never suppose it, even in
its state of original integrity, to have been of very capacious
dimensions. Its site is most commanding.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XVIII.</H3>

<P>BIBLIOGRAPHY. MONSIEUR ADAM. MONSIEUR DE LARENAUDIERE. OLIVIER
BASSELIN. M. SÉGUIN. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.</P>

<P>It is a sad rainy day; and having no temptation to stir abroad,
I have shut myself up by the side of a huge wood fire--(surrounded
by the dingy tapestry, of which my last letter did not make very
honourable mention) in a thoroughly communicative mood--to make you
acquainted with all that has passed since my previous despatch.
Books and the Bibliomania be the chief &quot;burden of my present
song!&quot; You may remember, in my account of the public library
at Caen, that some mention was made of a certain OLIVIER BASSELIN--
whom I designated as the DRUNKEN BARNABY <EM>of Normandy</EM>.
Well, my friend--I have been at length made happy, and comforted in
the extreme, by the possession of a copy of the <EM>Vaudevires</EM>
of that said Olivier Basselin--and from the hands, too, of one of
his principal editors ... Monsieur Lanon de Larenaudiere, Avocat,
et Maire, de Tallevende-le-Petit. This copy I intend (as indeed I
told the donor) for the beloved library at Althorp. But let me tell
my tale my own way.</P>

<P>Hard by the hotel of the <EM>Cheval Blanc</EM>, (the best, bad
as it is-- and indeed the only one in the town) lives a printer of
the name of ADAM. He is the principal, and the most respectable of
his brethren in the same craft. After discoursing upon sundry
desultory topics--and particularly examining the <EM>books of
Education</EM>, among which I was both surprised and pleased to
find the <EM>Distichs of Muretus</EM><A name="fnref_160"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_160">160</A>--I expressed my regret at
having travelled through so many towns of Normandy without meeting
with one single copy of the <EM>Vaudevires of Olivier Basselin</EM>
for sale. &quot;It is not very surprising, Sir, since it is a
privately printed book, and was never intended for sale. The
impression too is very limited. You know, Sir, that the book was
published here--and--&quot; &quot;Then I begin to be confident
about obtaining it&quot;--replied I. &quot;Gently, Sir;--&quot;
resumed Monsieur Adam--&quot;it is not to be bought, even here. But
do you know no one...?&quot; &quot;Not a creature.&quot;
&quot;Well, Sir, take courage. You are an Englishman. One of its
principal editors--a very gallant <EM>Bibliomaniac</EM>--who is a
great collector and lover of the literature of your country--(here
I picked up courage and gaiety of heart) lives in this town. He is
President of the Tribunal. Go to him.&quot; Seeing me hesitate, in
consequence of not having a letter of introduction--&quot;Ce
n&#39;est rien (said he) allez tout-droit. Il aime vos
compatriotes; et soyez persuadé de l&#39;accueil le plus
favorable.&quot; Methought Monsieur Adam spake more eloquently than
I had yet heard a Norman speak.<A name="fnref_161"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_161">161</A></P>

<P>In two seconds I quitted his shop, (promising to return with an
account of my reception) and five minutes brought me into the
presence of Monsieur Lanon de Larenaudiere, Président du Tribunal,
&amp;c. It is not possible for me to convey to you a notion of the
warmth, cordiality, and joyousness of heart, that marked the
reception which this gentleman instantly gave me: and I will
frankly own that I was as much &quot;abashed&quot; as ever our
ancient friend Caxton had been--in the presence of his patroness
the Duchess of Burgundy. I followed my new bibliomaniacal
acquaintance rapidly up stairs; and witnessed, with extreme
pleasure, a few bundles of books (some of them English) lying upon
the window seats of the first landing-place; much after the fashion
followed in a certain long, rambling, and antique residence, not
quite three quarters of a mile from the towers of Westminster
Abbey.</P>

<P>On gaining the first floor, mine host turned the keys of the
doors of two contiguous rooms, and exclaimed, &quot;VOILA MA
BIBLIOTHEQUE!&quot; The air of conscious triumph with which these
words were uttered, delighted me infinitely; but my delight was
much increased on a leisurely survey of one of the prettiest, most
useful, and commendable collections of books, chiefly in the
department of the Belles-Lettres, which I had ever witnessed.
Monsieur de Larenaudiere has a library of about 9000 volumes, of
which <EM>eight hundred are English</EM>. But the owner is
especially fond of poetical archaeology; in other words, of
collecting every work which displays the progress of French and
English poetry in the middle and immediately following ages; and
talks of <EM>Trouveurs</EM> and <EM>Troubadours</EM> with an
enthusiasm approaching to extacy. Meanwhile he points his finger to
our Warton, Ellis, Ritson, and Southey; tells you how dearly he
loves them; but yet leads you to conclude that he <EM>rather</EM>
prefers <EM>Le Grand, Ginguené, Sismondi</EM>, and
<EM>Raynouard</EM>. Of the venerable living oracle in these
matters, the Abbé de la Rue, he said he considered him as &quot;un
peu trop systématique.&quot; In short, M. de Larenaudiere has
almost a complete critical collection, in our tongue, upon the
subject of old poetry; and was most anxious and inquisitive about
the present state of cultivation of that branch of literature in
England: adding, that he himself meditated a work upon the French
poetry of the XIIth and XIIIth centuries. He said he thought his
library might be worth about 25,000 francs: nor did I consider such
a valuation overcharged. He talks rapidly, earnestly, and
incessantly; but he talks well: and spoke of the renown of a
certain library in <EM>St. James&#39;s Place</EM>, in a manner
which could not fail to quicken the pulse and warm the blood of its
Librarian. I concluded an interview of nearly two hours, by his
compliance with my wish to dine with me on the following day:
although he was quite urgent in bargaining for the previous measure
of my tasting his <EM>pôtage</EM> and <EM>vol au vent</EM>. But the
shortness and constant occupation of my time would not allow me to
accede to it. M. de Larenaudiere then went to a cabinet-like
cupboard, drew forth an uncut copy, stitched in blue spotted paper,
of his beloved <EM>Vaudevires</EM> of OLIVIER BASSELIN:<A name=
"fnref_162"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_162">162</A> and
presenting it to me, added &quot;Conservez le, pour l&#39;amour de
moi.&quot; You may be assured that I received such a present in the
most gracious manner I was capable of--but instantly and honestly
added--&quot;permettez qu&#39;il soit déposé dans la bibliothèque
de Milord S...? &quot;C&#39;est la même chose&quot;--rejoined he;
and giving me the address of the public librarian, we separated in
the most cordial manner till the morrow.</P>

<P>I posted back to Monsieur Adam, the printer and bookseller, and
held aloft my blue-covered copy of the <EM>Vaudevires</EM> as an
unquestionable proof of the successful result of my visit to
Monsieur La Renaudiere. Leaving the precious cargo with him, and
telling him that I purposed immediately visiting the public
library, he seemed astonished at my eagerness about books--and
asked me if I had ever <EM>published</EM> any thing
<EM>bibliographical</EM>? &quot;Car enfin, Monsieur, la pluspart
des <EM>Virois</EM> ne savent rien de la litérature
angloise&quot;--concluded he ... But I had just witnessed a
splendid exception to this sweeping clause of censure. I then
sought the residence of the Abbé Du MORTUEUX, the public librarian.
That gentleman was from home, at a dinner party. I obtained
information of the place where he might be found; and considering
<EM>two</EM> o&#39;clock to be rather too early an hour (even in
France) to disturb a gentleman during the exercise of so important
a function, I strolled in the neighbourhood of the street, where he
was regaling, for a full hour and half: when, at the expiration of
that time, I ventured to knock at the door of a very respectable
mansion, and to enquire for the bibliographical Abbé. &quot;He is
here, Sir, and has just done dinner. May I give him your
name?&quot; &quot;I am a stranger: an Englishman; who, on the
recommendation of Monsieur Larenaudiere, wishes to see the public
library. But I will call again in about an hour.&quot; &quot;By no
means: by no means: the Abbé will see you immediately.&quot; And
forthwith appeared a very comely, tall, and respectable- looking
gentleman, with his hair en plein costume, both as to form and
powder. Indeed I had rarely before witnessed so prepossessing a
figure. His salutation and address were most gracious and winning;
and he told me that I had nothing to do but to accompany him to the
place which I wished to visit. Without even returning to his
friends, he took his hat--and in one minute, to my surprise, I
found myself in the street with the Abbé de Mortueux, in the high
way to the PUBLIC LIBRARY. In our way thither our discourse was
constant and unrestrained. &quot;You appear here; Monsieur
l&#39;Abbé, to be partial to literature;... but allow me first to
congratulate you on the beautiful environs of your town.&quot;
&quot;For literature in general, we are pretty well disposed. In
regard to the beauties of the immediate neighbourhood of Vire, we
should be unworthy inhabitants indeed, if we were not sensible of
them.&quot; In five minutes we reached the Library.</P>

<P>The shutters of the room were fastened, but the worthy Abbé
opened them in a trice; when I saw, for the first time in Normandy,
what appeared to be a genuine, old, unmutilated, unpillaged
library. The room could be scarcely more than twenty-two feet
square. I went instantly to work, with eyes and hands, in the
ardent hope, and almost full persuasion, of finding something in
the shape of a good old Greek or Roman Classic, or French
Chronicle, or Romance. But, alas, I looked, and handled the tomes
in vain! The history of the library is this:--The founder was a
Monsieur PICHON; who, on being taken prisoner by the English, at
the capture of Louisburg in 1758, resided a long time in England
under the name of TYRREL, and lived in circumstances of
respectability and even of opulence. There--whether on the
dispersion of the libraries of our Meads, Foulkes&#39;, and
Rawlinsons, I know not--he made his collection; took his books over
with him to Jersey, where he died in 1780: and bequeathed them,
about 3000 in number, to his native town of Vire. M. du Mortueux,
who gave me these particulars, has drawn up a little memorial about
Pichon. His portrait, executed by an English artist, (whilst he
lived among us) adorns the library; with which I hope it will go
down to a distant and grateful posterity. The colouring of this
portrait is faded: but it is evident that Monsieur Pichon had an
expressive and sensible physiognomy.</P>

<P>Wonderful to relate, this collection of books was untouched
during the Revolution; while the neighbouring library of the
<EM>Cordeliers</EM> was ransacked without mercy. But I regret to
say that the books in the cupboards are getting sadly damp. Do not
expect any thing very marvellous in the details of this collection;
The old-fashioned library doors, of wood, are quite in character
with what they protect. Among the earlier printed books, I saw a
very bad copy of <EM>Sweynheym and Pannartz&#39;s</EM> edition of
the <EM>De Civitate Dei</EM> of St. Austin, of the date of 1470;
and a large folio of <EM>Gering&#39;s</EM> impression of the
<EM>Sermons of Leonard de Utino</EM> printed about the year 1478.
This latter was rather a fine book. A little black-letter Latin
Bible by Froben, of the date of 1495, somewhat tempted me; but I
could not resist asking, in a manner half serious and half jocose,
whether a napoleon would not secure me the possession of a piquant
little volume of black-letter tracts, printed by my old friend
Guido Mercator?<A name="fnref_163"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_163">163</A> The Abbé smiled: observing--&quot;mon ami, on
fait voir les livres ici; on les lit même: mais on ne les vend
pas.&quot; I felt the force of this pointed reply: and was resolved
never again to ask an Ecclesiastic to part with a black-letter
volume, even though it should be printed by &quot;my old friend
Guido Mercator.&quot;</P>

<P>Seeing there was very little more deserving of investigation, I
enquired of my amiable guide about the &quot;LIBRARY OF THE
CORDELIERS,&quot; of which he had just made mention. He told me
that it consisted chiefly of canon and civil law, and had been
literally almost destroyed: that he had contrived however to secure
a great number of &quot;rubbishing theological books,&quot; (so he
called them!) which he sold for <EM>three sous</EM> a piece--and
with the produce of which he bought many excellent works for the
library. I should like to have had the sifting of this
&quot;theological rubbish!&quot; It remained only to thank the Abbé
most heartily for his patient endurance of my questions and
searches, and particularly to apologise for bringing him from his
surrounding friends. He told me, beginning with a &quot;soyez
tranquille,&quot; that the matter was not worth either a thought or
a syllable; and ere we quitted the library, he bade me observe the
written entries of the numbers of students who came daily thither
to read. There were generally (he told me) from fifteen to twenty
&quot;hard at it&quot;--and I saw the names of not fewer than
<EM>ninety-two</EM> who aspired to the honour and privilege of
having access to the BIBLIOTHECA PICHONIANA.</P>

<P>For the third time, in the same day, I visited Monsieur Adam; to
carry away, like a bibliomaniacal Jason, the fleece I had secured.
I saw there a grave, stout gentleman--who saluted me on my
entrance, and who was introduced to me by Monsieur A. by the name
of SÉGUIN. He had been waiting (he said) full three quarters of an
hour to see me, and concluded by observing, that, although a man in
business, he had aspired to the honour of authorship. He had
written, in fact, two rather interesting--but wretchedly, and
incorrectly printed--duodecimo volumes, relating to the BOCAGE,<A
name="fnref_164"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_164">164</A> in the
immediate vicinity of Vire; and was himself the sole vender and
distributer of his publications. On my expressing a wish to possess
these books, he quitted the premises, and begged I would wait his
return with a copy or two of them. While he was gone, M. Adam took
the opportunity of telling me that he was a rich, respectable
tradesman; but that, having said some severe things of the
manufactures of Vire in his <EM>first</EM> publication,<A name=
"fnref_165"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_165">165</A> relating to
the <EM>civil</EM> history of the Bocains, his townsmen sharply
resented what they considered as reflections thrown out against
them; and M. Séguin was told that perhaps his personal safety was
endangered ... He wanted not a second hint--but fled from home with
precipitancy: and in his absence the populace suspended his effigy,
and burnt it before the door of his house. This, however, did not
<EM>cool</EM> the ardour of authorship in M. Séguin. He set about
publishing his <EM>military</EM> history of the Bocains; and in the
introductory part took occasion to retort upon the violence of his
persecutors. To return to M. Séguin. In about ten minutes he
appeared, with two copies in his hand-- which I purchased, I
thought dearly, at five francs each volume; or a napoleon for the
four books. After the adventures of this day, I need hardly tell
you that I relished a substantial dinner at a late hour, and that I
was well satisfied with Vire.</P>

<P>Yesterday M. de Larenaudiere made good his engagement, and dined
with me at five, in the salle à manger. This is a large inn; and if
good fare depended upon the number and even elegance of female
cooks, the traveller ought to expect the very best at the
<EM>Cheval Blanc</EM>. The afternoon was so inviting--and my guest
having volunteered his services to conduct me to the most beautiful
points of view in the immediate neighbourhood--that we each seemed
to vie with the other in quickly dispatching what was placed before
us; and within thirty-five minutes, from the moment of sitting
down, we were in the outskirts of Vire. Never shall I forget that
afternoon&#39;s ramble. The sun seemed to become more of a golden
hue, and the atmosphere to increase in clearness and serenity. A
thousand little songsters were warbling in the full-leaved branches
of the trees; while the mingled notes of the
<EM>blanchisseuses</EM> and the milk-maids, near the banks of the
rippling stream below, reached us in a sort of wild and joyous
harmony--as we gazed down from the overhanging heights. The meadows
were spotted with sheep, and the orchards teemed with the coming
fruit. You may form some notion of the value of this rich and
picturesque scenery, when I tell you that M. de Larenaudiere
possesses land, in the immediate vicinity of Vire, which lets per
acre at the rate of <EM>6l.</EM> <EM>6s.</EM> English. My guide was
all gaiety of heart, and activity of step. I followed him through
winding paths and devious tracks, amidst coppice-wood and fern--not
however till I had viewed, from one particular spot upon the
heights, a most commanding and interesting panorama of the town of
Vire.</P>

<P>In our perambulation, we discoursed of English poetry; and I
found that THOMSON was as great a favourite with my guide as with
the rest of his countrymen. Indeed he frankly told me that he had
translated him into French verse, and intended to publish his
translation. I urged him to quote specimens; which he did with a
readiness and force, and felicity of version, that quite delighted
me. He thoroughly understands the original; and in the description
of a cataract, or mountain torrent, from the Summer, he appeared to
me almost to surpass it. My guide then proceeded to quote Young and
Pope, and delivered his opinion of our two great Whig and Tory
Reviews. He said he preferred the politics and vivacity of the
<EM>Edinburgh</EM>, but thought the <EM>Quarterly</EM> more
instructive and more carefully written. &quot;Enfin (he concluded)
j&#39;aime infiniment votre gouvernement, et vos écrivains; mais
j&#39;aime moins le peuple Anglois.&quot; I replied that he had at
least very recently shewn an exception to this opinion, in his
treatment of <EM>one</EM> among this <EM>very</EM> people.
&quot;C&#39;est une autre chose&quot;--replied he briskly, and
laughingly--&quot;vous allez voir deux de vos compatriotes, qui
sont mes intimes, et vous en serez bien content!&quot; So saying,
we continued our route through a delightful avenue of beech-trees,
upon the most elevated part within the vicinity of the town; and my
companion bade me view from thence the surrounding country. It was
rich and beautiful in the extreme; and with perfect truth, I must
say, resembled much more strongly the generality of our own scenery
than what I had hitherto witnessed in Normandy. But the sun was
beginning to cast his shadows broader and broader, and where was
the residence of Monsieur and Madame S----?</P>

<P>It was almost close at hand. We reached it in a quarter of an
hour-- but the inmates were unluckily from home. The house is low
and long, but respectable in appearance both within and without.
The approach to it is through a pretty copse, terminated by a
garden; and the surrounding grounds are rather tastefully laid out.
A portion of it indeed had been trained into something in the shape
of a labyrinth; in the centre of which was a rocky seat, embedded
as it were in moss--and from which some fine glimpses were caught
of the surrounding country. The fragrance from the orchard trees,
which had not yet quite shed their blossoms, was perfectly
delicious; while the stillness of evening added to the peculiar
harmony of the whole. We had scarcely sauntered ten minutes before
Madame arrived. She had been twelve years in France, and spoke her
own language so imperfectly, or rather so unintelligibly, that I
begged of her to resume the French. Her reception of us was most
hospitable: but we declined cakes and wine, on account of the
lateness of the hour. She told us that her husband was in
possession of from fourscore to a hundred acres of the most
productive land; and regretted that he was from home, on a visit to
a neighbouring gentleman; assuring us, if we could stay, that he
would be heartily glad to see us--&quot;especially any of his
<EM>countrymen</EM>, when introduced by Monsieur de
Larenaudiere.&quot; It was difficult to say who smiled and bowed
with the greater complacency, at this double-shotted compliment. I
now pressed our retreat homewards. We bade this agreeable lady
farewell, and returned down the heights, and through the devious
paths by which we had ascended,</P>

<P class="poetry">While talk of various kind deceived the road.</P>

<P>A more active and profitable day has not yet been devoted to
Norman objects, whether of art or of nature. Tomorrow I breakfast
with my friend and guide, and immediately afterwards push on for
FALAISE. A cabriolet is hired, but doubts are entertained
respecting the practicability of the route. My next epistle will be
therefore from Falaise--where the renowned William the Conqueror
was born, whose body we left entombed at Caen. The day is clearing
up; and I yet hope for a stroll upon the site of the castle.</P>

HOTEL OF THE GRAND TURC. THE CASTLE OF FALAISE. BIBLIOMANIACAL
INTERVIEW.</P>

<P><EM>Falaise</EM>.</P>

<P>Here I am--or rather, here I have been--my most excellent
friend, for the last four days--and from hence you will receive
probably the last despatch from NORMANDY--from the &quot;land (as I
told you in my first epistle) of &quot;castles, churches, and
ancient chivalry.&quot; An old, well-situated,
respectably-inhabited, and even flourishing, town--the birth-place
too of our renowned FIRST WILLIAM:--weather, the most serene and
inviting--and hospitality, thoroughly hearty, and after the English
fashion:--these have all conspired to put me in tolerably good
spirits. My health, too, thank God, has been of late a little
improved. You wish me to continue the thread of my narrative
unbroken; and I take it up therefore from the preparation for my
departure from Vire.</P>

<P>I breakfasted, as I told you I was about to do, with my friend
and guide Mons. de Larenaudiere; who had prepared quite a sumptuous
repast for our participation. Coffee, eggs, sweetmeats, cakes, and
all the comfortable paraphernalia of an inviting breakfast-table,
convinced us that we were in well-furnished and respectable
quarters. Madame did the honours of the meal in perfectly good
taste; and one of the loveliest children I ever saw--a lad, of
about five or six years of age--with a profusion of hair of the
most delicate quality and colour, gave a sort of joyous character
to our last meal at Vire. The worthy host told me to forget him,
when I reached my own country;<A name="fnref_166"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_166">166</A> and that, if ever business or
pleasure brought me again into Normandy, to remember that the Maire
de Tallevende-le-Petit would-be always happy to renew his
assurances of hospitality. At the same time, he entreated me to pay
attention to a list of English books which he put into my hands;
and of which he stood considerably in need. We bade farewell in the
true English fashion, by a hearty shake of the hands; and, mounting
our voiture, gave the signal for departure. &quot;Au plaisir de
vous revoir!&quot;--&#39;till a turning of the carriage deprived us
of the sight of each other. It is not easy--and I trust it is not
natural--for me to forget the last forty-eight hours spent in the
interesting town of VIRE!</P>

<P>Our route to this place was equally grand and experimental;
grand, as to the width of the road, and beauty of the surrounding
country--but experimental, inasmuch as a part of the <EM>route
royale</EM> had been broken up, and rendered wholly impassable for
carriages of any weight. Our own, of its kind, was sufficiently
light; with a covering of close wicker-work, painted after the
fashion of some of our bettermost tilted carts. One Norman horse,
in full condition of flesh, with an equal portion of bone and
muscle, was to convey us to this place, which cannot be less than
twenty- two good long English miles from Vire. The carriage had no
springs; and our seat was merely suspended by pieces of leather
fastened at each end. At <EM>Condé</EM>, about one-third of the
distance, we baited, to let both man and horse breathe over their
dinners; while, strolling about that prettily situated little town,
we mingled with the inhabitants, and contemplated the various faces
(it being market-day) with no ordinary degree of gratification.
Amidst the bustle and variety of the scene, our ears were greeted
by the air of an itinerant ballad-singer: nor will you be
displeased if I send you a copy of it:--since it is gratifying to
find any thing like a return to the good old times of the sixteenth
century.</P>

<P>There was a freshness of tint, and a comeliness of appearance,
among the bourgeoises and common people, which were not to be
eclipsed even by the belles of Coutances. Our garçon de poste and
his able-bodied quadruped having each properly recruited
themselves, we set forward--by preference-- to walk up the very
long and somewhat steep hill which rises on the other side of Conde
towards <EM>Pont Ouilly</EM>--in the route hither. Perhaps this was
the most considerable ascent we had mounted on foot, since we had
left Rouen. The view from the summit richly repaid the toil of
using our legs. It was extensive, fruitful, and variegated; but
neither rock nor mountain scenery; nor castles, nor country seats;
nor cattle, nor the passing traveller--served to mark or to animate
it. It was still, pure nature, upon a vast and rich scale: and as
the day was fine, and my spirits good, I was resolved to view and
to admire.</P>

<P><EM>Pont Ouilly</EM> lies in a hollow; with a pretty winding
river, which seems to run through its centre. The surrounding hills
are gently undulating; and as we descended to the Inn, we observed,
over the opposite side of the town, upon the summit of one of the
hills, a long procession of men and women--headed by an
ecclesiastic, elevating a cross--who were about to celebrate, at
some little distance, one of their annual festivals. The effect--as
the procession came in contact with a bright blue sky, softened by
distance--was uncommonly picturesque ... but the day was getting on
fast, and there was yet a considerable distance to perform,--while,
in addition, we had to encounter the most impassable part of the
road. Besides, I had not yet eaten a morsel since I had left Vire.
Upon holding a consultation, therefore, it was resolved to make for
the inn, and to dine there. A more sheltered, rural, spot cannot be
conceived. It resembled very many of the snug scenes in South
Wales. Indeed the whole country was of a character similar to many
parts of Monmouthshire; although with a miserable draw-back in
respect to the important feature of <EM>wood</EM>. Through the
whole of Normandy, you miss those grand and overshadowing masses of
oak, which give to Monmouthshire, and its neighbouring county of
Glocester, that rich and majestic appearance which so decidedly
marks the character of those counties. However, we are now at the
inn at Pont Ouilly. A dish of river fish, gudgeons, dace, and
perch, was speedily put in requisition. Good wine, &quot;than which
France could boast no better!&quot; and a roast fowl, which the
daughter of the hostess &quot;knew how to dress to admiration&quot;
... was all that this humble abode could afford us.&quot; &quot;But
we were welcome:&quot;--that is, upon condition that we paid our
reckoning....</P>

<P>The dinner would be ready in a &quot;short half hour.&quot; Mr.
Lewis, went to the bridge, to look around, for the purpose of
exercising his pencil: while I sauntered more immediately about the
house. Within five minutes a well- looking, and even handsome,
young woman--of an extremely fair complexion-- her hair cut close
behind--her face almost smothered in a white cap which seemed of
crape--and habited in a deep black--passed quickly by me, and
ascended a flight of steps, leading to the door of a very humble
mansion. She smiled graciously at the <EM>aubergiste</EM> as she
passed her, and quickly disappeared. On enquiry, I was told that
she was a nun, who, since the suppression of the convent to which
she had belonged, earned her livelihood by teaching some of the
more respectable children in the village. She had just completed
her twentieth year. I was now addressed by a tall, bluff,
shabby-looking man--who soon led me to understand that he was
master of the inn where my &quot;suite&quot; was putting up;--that
I had been egregiously deceived about the nature of the road--for
that it was totally impossible for <EM>one</EM> horse:--even the
very best in Normandy--(and where will you find better? added he,
parenthetically--as I here give it to you) to perform the journey
with such a voiture and such a weight of luggage behind.&quot; I
was struck equally with amazement and woe at this intelligence. The
unpitying landlord saw my consternation. &quot;Hark you, sir ...
(rejoined he) if you <EM>must</EM> reach Falaise this evening,
there is only one method of doing it. You must have <EM>another
horse</EM>.&quot; &quot;Willingly,&quot; I replied. &quot;Yes,
sir--but you can have it only upon <EM>one</EM> condition.&quot;
&quot;What is that?&quot; &quot;I have some little business at
Falaise myself. Allow me to strap about one hundred weight of
loaf-sugar at the back of your conveyance, and I myself will be
your garçon de poste thither.&quot; I own I thought him about the
most impudent fellow I had yet seen in Normandy: but there was no
time for resistance. Necessity compelled acquiescence. Accordingly,
the dinner being dispatched--which, though good, was charged at six
francs a-head--we prepared for our departure.</P>

<P>But judge of my surprise and increased consternation, when the
fellow ordered forth a little runt of a quadruped--in the shape of
a horse--which was hardly higher than the lower part of the chest
of the animal which brought us from Vire! I remonstrated. The
landlord expostulated. I resisted--but the fellow said it was a
bargain; and proceeded quietly to deposit at least <EM>two</EM>
hundred weight of his refined sugar at the back of the carriage.
This Lilliputian horse was made the leader. The landlord mounted on
the front seat, with our Vire post-boy by the side of him; and
sounding his whip, with a most ear-piercing whoop and hollow, we
sprung forward for Falaise--which we were told we should reach
before sunset. You can hardly conceive the miseries of this
cross-road journey. The route royale was, in fact, completely
impassable; because they were repairing it. Alarmed at the
ruggedness of the cross-road, where one wheel was in a rut of
upwards of a foot deep, and the other elevated in proportion--we
got out, and resolved to push on a-foot. We walked for nearly two
leagues, before our conveyance overtook us--so harassing and so
apparently insurmountable seemed to be the road. But the cunning
aubergiste had now got rid of his leader. He said that it was only
necessary to use it for the first two or three leagues--which was
the most difficult part of the route- -and that, for the remainder,
about five English miles, our &quot;fine Norman horse&quot; was
perfectly sufficient. This fine Norman horse was treated most
unmercifully by him. He flogged, he hallooed, he swore ... the
animal tript, stumbled, and fell upon his knees--more than
once--from sheer fatigue. The charioteer hallooed and flogged
again: and I thought we must have taken up our night quarters in
the high-way;--when suddenly, to the left, I saw the fine warm glow
of the sun, which had set about twenty minutes, lighting up one of
the most perfect round towers, of an old castle, that I had yet
seen in Normandy. Voilà FALAISE!--exclaimed the ruthless
charioteer; ... and in a quarter of an hour we trotted hard down a
hill (after the horse had been twice again upon his knees) which
terminated in this most interesting place.</P>

<P>It will be difficult for me to forget--after such a long,
wearisome, and in part desperate journey--our approach to
Falaise:--and more especially the appearance of the castle just
mentioned. The stone seemed as fresh, and as perfectly cemented, as
if it had been the work of the preceding year. Moreover, the
contiguous parts were so fine and so thoroughly picturesque-- and
the superadded tradition of its being, according to some, the birth
place--and according to others, the usual residence--of WILLIAM THE
CONQUEROR ... altogether threw a charm about the first glimpse of
this venerable pile, which cannot be easily described. I had
received instructions to put up at the &quot;<EM>Grand
Turc</EM>&quot;--as the only hotel worthy an Englishman&#39;s
notice. At the door of the Grand Turk, therefore, we were safely
deposited: after having got rid of our incumbrances of two
postilions, and two hundred weight of refined sugar. Our reception
was gracious in the extreme. The inn appeared &quot;tout-à-fait à
la mode Anglaise&quot;--and no marvel ... for Madame the hostess
was an Englishwoman. Her husband&#39;s name was <EM>David</EM>.</P>

<P>Bespeaking a late cup of tea, I strolled through the principal
streets,-- delighted with the remarkably clear current of the
water, which ran on each side from the numerous overcharged
fountains. Day-light had wholly declined; when, sitting down to my
souchong, I saw, with astonishment--a <EM>pair of sugar-tongs</EM>
and a <EM>salt-spoon</EM>--the first of the kind I had beheld since
I left England! Madame David enjoyed my surprise; adding, in a very
droll phraseology, that she had &quot;not forgotten good English
customs.&quot; Our beds and bed rooms were perfectly comfortable,
and even elegant.</P>

<P>The moat which encircles, not only the castle, but the town--and
which must have been once formidable from its depth and breadth,
when filled with water--is now most pleasingly metamorphosed.
Pasture lands, kitchen gardens, and orchards, occupy it entirely.
Here the cattle quietly stray, and luxuriously feed. But the
metamorphosis of the <EM>castle</EM> has been, in an equal degree,
unfortunate. The cannon balls, during the wars of the League--and
the fury of the populace, with the cupidity or caprice of some
individuals, during the late revolution--helped to produce this
change. After breakfast, I felt a strong desire to survey carefully
the scite and structure of the castle. It was a lovely day; and in
five minutes I obtained admission at a temporary outer gate. The
first near view within the ramparts perfectly enchanted me. The
situation is at once bold, commanding, and picturesque. But as the
opposite, and immediately contiguous ground, is perhaps yet a
little higher, it should follow that a force, placed upon such
eminence--as indeed was that of Henry the Fourth, during the wars
of the League--would in the end subdue the garrison, or demolish
the castle. I walked here and there amidst briars and brushwood,
diversified with lilacs and laburnums; and by the aid of the guide
soon got within an old room--of which the outer walls only
remained--and which is distinguished by being called the
<EM>birth-place</EM> of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</P>

<P>Between ourselves, the castle appears to be at least a century
later than the time of William the Conqueror; and certainly the
fine round tower, of which such frequent mention has been made, is
rather of the fourteenth, if not of the beginning of the fifteenth
century;<A name="fnref_167"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_167">167</A> but it is a noble piece of masonry. The stone is
of a close grain and beautiful colour, and the component parts are
put together with a hard cement, and with the smallest possible
interstices. At the top of it, on the left side, facing the high
road from Vire,--and constructed within the very walls themselves,
is a <EM>well</EM>--which goes from the top apparently to the very
bottom of the foundation, quite to the bed of the moat. It is about
three feet in diameter, measuring with the eye; perhaps four: but
it is doubtless a very curious piece of workmanship. We viewed with
an inquisitive eye what remained of the <EM>Donjon</EM>: sighed, as
we surveyed the ruins of the <EM>chapel</EM>--a very interesting
little piece of ecclesiastical antiquity: and shuddered as we
contemplated the enormous and ponderous portcullis-- which had a
<EM>drop of</EM> full twenty feet ... to keep out the invading foe.
I was in truth delighted with this first reconnoissance of
FALAISE--beneath one of the brightest and bluest skies of Normandy!
and--within walls, which were justly considered to be among the
most perfect as well as the most ancient of those in Normandy.</P>

<P>Leaving my companion to take a view of the upper part of this
venerable building, I retreated towards the town--resolved to leave
no church and no street unexplored. On descending, and quitting the
gate by which I had entered, a fine, robust, and respectable
figure, habited as an Ecclesiastic, met and accosted me. I was most
prompt to return the salutation. &quot;We are proud, Sir, of our
castle, and I observe you have been visiting it. The English ought
to take an interest in it, since it was the birth-place of William
the Conqueror.&quot; I readily admitted it was well worth a minute
examination: but as readily turned the conversation to the subject
of LIBRARIES. The amiable stranger (for he was gaining upon me
fast, by his unaffected manners and sensible remarks) answered,
that &quot;their <EM>own</EM> public library existed no
longer--having been made subservient to the inquisitorial visit of
M. Moysant of Caen<A name="fnref_168"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_168">168</A>: that he had himself procured for the Bishop of
Bayeux the <EM>Mentz Bible</EM> of 1462--and that the
Chapter-Library of Bayeux, before the Revolution, could not have
contained fewer than 40,000 volumes. &quot;But you are doubtless
acquainted, Sir, with the COMTE DE LA FRESNAYE, who resides in
yonder large mansion?&quot;-- pointing to a house upon an elevated
spot on the other side of the town. I replied that I had not that
honour; and was indeed an utter stranger to every inhabitant of
Falaise. I then stated, in as few and precise words as possible,
the particular object of my visit to the Continent. &quot;Cela
suffit&quot;--resumed the unknown--&quot;nous irons faire visite à
Monsieur le Comte après le diné; à ce moment il s&#39;occupe avec
le pôtage--car c&#39;est un jour maigre. Il sera charmé de vous
recevoir. Il aime infiniment les Anglois, et il a resté long-temps
chez vous. C&#39;est un brave homme--et même un grand
antiquaire.&quot;</P>

<P>My pulse and colour increased sensibly as the stranger uttered
these latter words: and he concluded by telling me that he was
himself the Curé of <EM>Ste. Trinité</EM> one of the two principal
churches of the town--and that his name was MOUTON. Be assured that
I shall not lose sight of the Comte de la Fresnaye, and Monsieur
Mouton.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XX.</H3>

<P>MONS. MOUTON. CHURCH OF STE. TRINITÉ. COMTE DE LA FRESNAYE.
GUIBRAY CHURCH. SUPPOSED HEAD OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. M.
LANGEVIN, HISTORIAN OF FALAISE. PRINTING OFFICES.</P>

<P>I lose no time in the fulfilment of my promise. The church of
SAINTE TRINITÉ, of which Monsieur Mouton is the Curé, is the second
place of worship in rank in the town. During the Revolution, Mons.
Mouton was compelled, with too many of his professional brethren,
to fly from the general persecution of his order. One solitary and
most amiable creature only remained; of the name of LANGEVIN--of
whom, by and by, Monsieur Mouton did me the honour of shewing me
the interior of his church. His stipend (as he told me) did not
exceed 1500 francs per annum; and it is really surprising to
observe to what apparent acts of generosity towards his flock, this
income is made subservient. You shall hear. The altar consists of
two angels of the size of life, kneeling very gracefully, in white
glazed plaister: in the centre, somewhat raised above, is a figure
of the Virgin, of the same materials; above which again, is a
representation of the TRINITY--in a blaze of gilt. The massive
circular columns surrounding the choir--probably of the fourteenth
century--were just fresh painted, at the expense of the worthy
Curé, in alternate colours of blue and yellow-- imitative of
marble;--that is to say, each column, alternately, was blue and
yellow. It was impossible to behold any thing more glaring and more
tasteless. I paid my little tribute of admiration at the simplicity
and grace of the kneeling figure of the Virgin--but was stubbornly
silent about every thing else. Monsieur Mouton replied that
&quot;he intended to grace the brows of the angels by putting a
<EM>garland</EM> round each.&quot; I felt a sort of twinge upon
receiving this intelligence; but there is no persuading the French
to reject, or to qualify, their excessive fondness for flower
ornaments.</P>

<P>Projecting from the wall, behind the circular part of the choir,
I observed a figure of <EM>St. Sebastian</EM>--precisely of that
character which we remark in the printed missals of the fifteenth
century,--and from which the engravers of that period copied them:
namely, with the head large, the body meagre, and the limbs loose
and muscular. It was plentifully covered, as was the whole surface
of the wall, with recent white wash. On observing this, my guide
added: &quot;oui, et je veux le faire couvrir d&#39;une teinte
encore plus blanche!&quot; Here I felt a second twinge yet more
powerful than the first. I noticed, towards the south-side door, a
very fine crucifix, cut in wood, about three feet high; and
apparently of the time of Goujon. It was by much the finest piece
of sculpture, of its kind, which I had seen in Normandy; but it was
rather in a decaying state. I wished to know whether such an object
of art--apparently of no earthly importance, where it was
situated--might be obtained for some honourable and adequate
compensation. Monsieur Mouton replied that he desired to part with
it--but that it must be replaced by another &quot;full six feet
high!&quot; There was no meeting this proposition, and I ceased to
say another word upon the subject.</P>

<P>Upon the whole, the church of the Holy Trinity is rather a fine
and capacious, than a venerable edifice; and although I cannot
conscientiously approve of the beautifying and repairing which are
going on therein, yet I will do the <EM>planner</EM> the justice to
say, that a more gentlemanly, liberally-minded, and truly amiable
clergyman is perhaps no where to be found,--within or without the
diocese to which he belongs. Attached to the north transept or side
door, parallel with the street, is a long pole. &quot;What might
this mean?&quot; &quot;Sir, this pole was crowned at the top by a
garland, and by the white flag of <EM>St. Louis</EM>,<A name=
"fnref_169"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_169">169</A>--which were
hoisted to receive me on my return from my long
expatriation&quot;--and the eyes of the narrator were suffused with
tears, as he made the answer! It is of no consequence how small the
income of an unmarried minister, may be, when he thus lives so
entirely in the HEARTS OF HIS FLOCK. This church bears abundant
evidence, within and without, of what is called the restoration of
the Gothic order during the reign of Francis I.: although the most
essential and the greater portion is evidently of the latter part
of the fourteenth century.<A name="fnref_170"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_170">170</A> Having expressed my admiration of the
manufacture of wax candles (for religious purposes) which I had
frequently observed in the town, Monsieur Mouton, upon taking me
into the sacristy (similar to our vestry-room) begged I would do
him the honour to accept of any which might be lying upon the
table. These candles are made of the purest white wax: of a spiral,
or twisted, or square, or circular form; of considerable length and
width. They are also decorated with fillagree work, and tinsel of
various colours. Upon that which I chose, there were little
rosettes made of wax. The moderate sum for which they are obtained,
startles an Englishman who thinks of the high price of this article
of trade in his own country. You see frequently, against the walls
and pillars of the choir, fragments of these larger wax candles,
guttering down and begrimed from the uses made of them in time of
worship. In this sacristy there were two little boys swinging
<EM>wooden</EM> censers, by way of practice for the more perfect
use of them, when charged with frankincense, at the altar. To
manage these adroitly--as the traveller is in the constant habit of
observing during divine worship--is a matter of no very quick or
easy attainment.</P>

<P>From the Curé we proceed to the Comte DE LA FRESNAYE; whose
pleasantly situated mansion had been pointed out to me, as you may
remember, by the former. Passing over one of the bridges, leading
towards <EM>Guibray</EM>, and ascending a gentle eminence to the
left, I approached the outer lodge of this large and
respectable-looking mansion. The Count and family were at dinner:
but at <EM>three</EM> they would rise from table.
&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; said the porter, it might give me pleasure
to walk in the garden.&quot; It was one of the loveliest days
imaginable. Such a sky--blue, bright, and cloudless--I had scarcely
before seen. The garden was almost suffocated with lilacs and
laburnums, glittering in their respective liveries of white,
purple, and yellow. I stepped into a berceau--and sitting upon a
bench, bethought me of the strange visit I was about to make--as
well as of all the pleasing pastoral poetry and painting which I
had read in the pages of De Lille, or viewed upon the canvas of
Watteau. The clock of the church of <EM>St. Gervais</EM> struck
three; when, starting from my reverie, I knocked at the hall-door,
and was announced to the family, (who had just risen from dinner)
above stairs. A circle of five gentlemen would have alarmed a very
nervous visitor; but the Count, addressing me in a semi-British and
semi- Gallic phraseology, immediately dissipated my fears. In five
minutes he was made acquainted with the cause of this apparent
intrusion.</P>

<P>Nothing could exceed his amiable frankness. The very choicest
wine was circulated at his table; of which I partook in a more
decided manner on the following day--when he was so good as to
invite me to dine. When I touched upon his favourite theme of
Norman Antiquities, he almost shouted aloud the name of
INGULPH,--that &quot;cher ami de Guillaume le Conquérant!&quot; I
was unwilling to trespass long; but I soon found the advantage of
making use of the name of &quot;Monsieur Mouton--l&#39;estimable
Curé de la Sainte Trinité.&quot;</P>

<P>In a stroll to Guibray, towards sunset the next day, I passed
through a considerable portion of the Count&#39;s property, about
300 acres, chiefly of pasture land. The evening was really
enchanting; and through the branches of the coppice wood the sun
seemed to be setting in a bed of molten gold. Our conversation was
animated and incessant. In the old and curious church of Guibray,
the Count shewed us his family pew with the care and particularity
of an old country squire. Meanwhile Mr. Lewis was making a hasty
copy of one of the very singular ornaments--representing <EM>Christ
bearing his cross</EM>--which was suspended against the walls of
the altar of a side chapel.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><IMG width="100%" src=
"images/379.png" alt="Christ bearing his cross"></DIV>

<P>You have it here. It is frightfully barbarous, and
characteristic of the capricious style of art which frequently
prevailed about the year 1520: but the wonder is, how such a
wretched performance could obtain admission into the sanctuary
where it was deposited. It was however the pious gift of the vestry
woman--who shewed us the interior--and who had religiously rescued
it, during the Revolution, from the demolition of a neighbouring
abbey. The eastern end of this church is perhaps as old as any
ecclesiastical edifice in Normandy;<A name="fnref_171"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_171">171</A> and its exterior (to which we
could only approach by wading through rank grass as high as our
knees) is one of the most interesting of its kind. During our
admiration of all that was curious in this venerable edifice, we
were struck by our old friends, the <EM>penitents</EM>,--busy in
making confession. In more than one confessional there were two
penitents; and towards one of these, thus doubly attended, I saw a
very large, athletic, hard-visaged priest hastening, just having
slipt on his surplice in the vestry. Indeed I had been cursorily
introduced to him by the Count. It was Saturday evening, and the
ensuing Sunday was to be marked by some grand procession.</P>

<P>The village-like town of Guibray presents a most singular sight
to the eye of a stranger. There are numerous little narrow streets,
with every window closed by wooden shutters, and every door
fastened. It appears as if the plague had recently raged there, and
that the inhabitants had quitted it for ever. Not a creature is
visible: not a sound is heard: not a mouse seems to be stirring.
And yet Guibray boasts of the LARGEST FAIR in France, save one!<A
name="fnref_172"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_172">172</A> This,
my friend, precisely accounts for the aspect of desolation just
described. During the intervals of these <EM>triennial</EM> fairs,
the greater part of the village is uninhabited: venders and
purchasers flocking and crowding by hundreds when they take place.
In a short, narrow street--where nothing animated was to be
seen--the Count assured me that sometimes, in the course of one
morning, several millions of francs were spent in the purchase of
different wares. We left this very strange place with our minds
occupied by a variety of reflections: but at any rate highly
pleased and gratified by the agreeable family which had performed
the part of guides on the occasion. In the evening, a professor of
music treated us with some pleasing tunes upon the guitar--which
utterly astonished the Count--and it was quite night-fall when we
returned homewards, towards our quarters at the hotel of the
<EM>Grand Turc</EM>.</P>

<P>A memorable incident occurred in our way homewards; which, when
made known, will probably agitate the minds and shake the faith of
two-thirds of the members of our Society of Antiquaries. You may
remember that I told you, when at Caen, that the Abbe De la Rue had
notified to me what were the objects more particularly deserving of
attention in my further progress through Normandy. Among these, he
particularly mentioned a figure or head of William the Conqueror at
Falaise. In the <EM>Place St. Gervais</EM>, this wonderful head was
said to exist--and to exist there only. It was at the house of an
Innkeeper--certainly not moving in the highest circle of his
calling. I lost little time in visiting it; and found it situated
at the top of a dark narrow staircase, projecting from the wall, to
the right, just before you reach the first floor. Some sensation
had been excited by the enquiries, which I had previously set on
foot; and on a second visit, several people were collected to
receive us. Lights, warm water, towels, soap and brushes, were
quickly put in requisition. I commenced operations with a kitchen
knife, by carefully scraping away all the layers of hardened white
and ochre washes, with which each generation had embedded and
almost obliterated every feature. By degrees, the hair became
manifest: then followed the operation of soap and water--which
brought out the features of the face; and when the eyes fully and
distinctly appeared, the exclamation of &quot;<EM>Mon
Dieu</EM>!&quot; by the spectators, was loud and unremitting. The
nose had received a serious injury by having its end broken off.
Anon, stood forth the mouth; and when the &quot;whiskered
majesty&quot; of the beard became evident, it was quite impossible
to repress the simultaneous ejaculation of joy and astonishment ...
&quot;<EM>Voilà le vrai portrait de Guillaume le
Conquérant</EM>!</P>

<P>The whiskers apparently denote it to be rather <EM>Saxon</EM>
than <EM>Norman</EM>. The head is nearly eleven inches in length,
by seven and a half in width: is cut upon a very coarse, yet
hard-grained stone--and rests upon a square, unconnected
stone:--embedded within the wall. If it ever had shoulders and
body, those shoulders and body were no part of the present
appendages of the head. What then, is the Abbé de la Rue in error?
The more liberal inference will be, that the Abbé de la Rue had
never seen it. As to its antiquity, I am prepared to admit it to be
very considerable; and, if you please, even before the period of
the loves of the father and mother of the character whom it is
supposed to represent. In the morning, Madame Rolle seemed disposed
to take ten louis (which I freely offered her) for her precious
fragment: but the distinct, collected view of whiskers, mouth,
nose, eyes, and hair, instantaneously raised the quicksilver of her
expectations to &quot;<EM>quinze</EM> louis pour le moins!&quot;
That was infinitely &quot;trop fort&quot;--and we parted without
coming to any terms. Perhaps you will laugh at me for the previous
offer.</P>

<P>The church of St. Gervais is called the mother church of the
town: and it is right that you should have some notion of it. It
stands upon a finely elevated situation. Its interior is rather
capacious: but it has no very grand effect-arising from simplicity
or breadth of architecture. The pillars to the right of the nave,
on entering from the western extremity, are doubtless old; perhaps
of the beginning of the thirteenth century. The arches are a
flattened semicircle; while those on the opposite side are
comparatively sharp, and of a considerably later period. The
ornaments of the capitals of these older pillars are, some of them,
sufficiently capricious and elaborate; while others are of a more
exceptionable character on the score of indelicacy. But this does
not surprise a man who has been accustomed to examine ART, of the
middle centuries, whether in sculpture or in painting. The side
aisles are comparatively modern. The pillars of the choir have
scarcely any capitals beyond a simple rim or fillet; and are
surmounted by sharp low arches, like what are to be seen at St. Lo
and Coutances. The roof of the left side aisle is perfectly green
from damp: the result, as at Coutances, of thereof having been
stripped for the sake of the lead to make bullets, &amp;c. during
the Revolution. I saw this large church completely filled on
Sunday, at morning service--about eleven: and, in the congregation,
I observed several faces and figures, of both sexes, which
indicated great intelligence and respectability. Indeed there was
much of the air of a London congregation about the whole.</P>

<P>From the Church, we may fairly make any thing but a
digression--in discoursing of one of its brightest ornaments, in
the person of Monsieur LANGEVIN:--a simple priest--as he styles
himself in an octavo volume, which entitles him to the character of
the best living HISTORIAN OF FALAISE. He is a mere officiating
minister in the church of Mons. Mouton; and his salary, as he led
me to infer, could be scarcely twenty louis per annum. Surely this
man is among the most amiable and excellent of God&#39;s creatures!
But it is right that you should know the origin and progress of our
acquaintance. It was after dinner, on one of the most industriously
spent of my days here--and the very second of my arrival,--that the
waiter announced the arrival of the Abbé Langevin, in the passage,
with a copy of his History beneath his arm. The door opened, and in
walked the stranger-- habited in his clerical garb--with a
physiognomy so benign and expressive, and with manners so gentle
and well-bred,--that I rose instinctively from my seat to give him
the most cordial reception. He returned my civility in a way which
shewed at once that he was a man of the most interesting simplicity
of character. &quot;He was aware (he said) that he had intruded;
but as he understood &quot;Monsieur was in pursuit of the
antiquities of the place, he had presumed to offer for his
acceptance a copy of a work upon that subject--of which he was the
humble author.&quot; This work was a good sized thick crown octavo,
filling five hundred closely and well-printed pages; and of which
the price was <EM>fifty sous</EM>! The worthy priest, seeing my
surprise on his mentioning the price, supposed that I had
considered it as rather extravagant. But this error was rectified
in an instant. I ordered <EM>three copies</EM> of his historical
labours, and told him my conscience would not allow me to pay him
less than <EM>three francs</EM> per copy. He seemed to be
electrified: rose from his seat:--and lifting up one of the most
expressive of countenances, with eyes apparently suffused with
tears-- raised both his hands, and exclaimed.... &quot;Que le bon
Dieu vous bénisse--les Anglois sont vraiement généreux!&quot;</P>

<P>For several seconds I sat riveted to my seat. Such an unfeigned
and warm acknowledgment of what I had considered as a mere
matter-of-course proposition, perfectly astounded me: the more so,
as it was accompanied by a gesture and articulation which could not
fail to move any bosom--not absolutely composed of marble. We each
rallied, and resumed the conversation. In few but simple words he
told me his history. He had contrived to weather out the
Revolution, at Falaise. His former preferment had been wholly taken
from him; and he was now a simple assistant in the church of Mons.
Mouton. He had yielded without resistance; as even
<EM>remonstrance</EM> would have been probably followed up by the
guillotine. To solace himself in his afflictions, he had recourse
to his old favourite studies of <EM>medicine</EM> and
<EM>music</EM>;--and had in fact practised the former. &quot;But
come, Sir, (says he) come and do me the honour of a call--when it
shall suit you.&quot; I settled it for the ensuing day. On breaking
up and taking leave, the amiable stranger modestly spoke of his
History. It had cost him three years&#39; toil; and he seemed to
mention, with an air of triumph, the frequent references in it to
the <EM>Gallia Christiana</EM>, and to <EM>Chartularies</EM> and
<EM>Family Records</EM> never before examined. On the next day I
carried my projected visit into execution--towards seven in the
evening. The lodgings of M. Langevin are on the second floor of a
house belonging to a carpenter. The worthy priest received me on
the landing- place, in the most cheerful and chatty manner. He has
three small rooms on the same floor. In the first, his library is
deposited. On my asking him to let me see what <EM>old books</EM>
he possessed, he turned gaily round, and replied--&quot;Comment
donc, Monsieur, vous aimez les vieux livres? A ça, voyons!&quot;
Whereupon he pulled away certain strips or pieces of wainscot, and
shewed me his book-treasures within the recesses. On my recognising
a <EM>Colinæus</EM> and <EM>Henry Stephen</EM>, ere he had read the
title of the volumes, he seemed to marvel exceedingly, and to gaze
at me as a conjuror. He betrayed more than ordinary satisfaction on
shewing his <EM>Latin Galen</EM> and <EM>Hippocrates</EM>; and the
former, to the best of my recollection, contained Latin notes in
the margin, written by himself. These tomes were followed up by a
few upon <EM>alchymy</EM> and <EM>astrology</EM>; from which, and
the consequent conversation, I was led to infer that the amiable
possessor entertained due respect for those studies which had
ravished our DEES and ASHMOLES of old.</P>

<P>In the second room stood an upright piano forte--the
<EM>manufacture</EM>, as well as the property, of Monsieur
Langevin. It bore the date of 1806; and was considered as the first
of the kind introduced into Normandy. It was impossible not to be
struck with the various rational sources of amusement, by means of
which this estimable character had contrived to beguile the hours
of his misfortunes. There was a calm, collected, serenity of manner
about him--a most unfeigned and unqualified resignation to the
divine will--which marked him as an object at once of admiration
and esteem. There was no boast--no cant--no formal sermonising. You
<EM>saw</EM> what religion had done for him. Her effects
<EM>spake</EM> in his discourse and in his life.... Over his piano
hung a portrait of himself; very indifferently executed--and not
strongly resembling the original. &quot;We can do something more
faithful than this, sir, if you will allow it&quot;--said I,
pointing to Mr. Lewis: and it was agreed that he should give the
latter a sitting on the morrow. The next day M. Langevin came
punctually to his appointment, for the purpose of having his
portrait taken.</P>

<P>On telling this original that the pencil drawing of Mr. Lewis
(which by the bye was executed in about an hour and a half) should
be <EM>engraved</EM>-- inasmuch as he was the modern <EM>Historian
of Falaise</EM>--he seemed absolutely astonished. He moved a few
paces gently forwards, and turning round, with hands and eyes
elevated, exclaimed, in a tremulous and heart- stricken tone of
voice, &quot;Ah, mon Dieu!&quot; I will not dissemble that I took
leave of him with tears, which were with difficulty concealed.
&quot;Adieu, pour toujours!&quot;--were words which he uttered with
all the sincerity, and with yet more pathos, than was even shewn by
Pierre Aimé Lair at Caen. The landlord and landlady of this hotel
are warm in their commendations of him: assuring me that his name
is hardly ever pronounced without the mention of his virtues. He
has just entered his sixty-second year.<A name="fnref_173"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_173">173</A></P>

<P>It remains only to give an account of the progress of Printing
and of Literature in this place: although the latter ought to
precede the former. As a literary man, our worthy acquaintance the
Comte de la Fresnaye takes the lead: yet he is rather an amateur
than a professed critic. He has written upon the antiquities of the
town; but his work is justly considered inferior to that of
Monsieur Langevin. He quotes <EM>Wace</EM> frequently, and with
apparent satisfaction; and he promises a French version of his
beloved <EM>Ingulph</EM>. Falaise is a quiet, dull place of resort,
for those who form their notions of retirement as connected with
the occasional bustle and animation of Caen and Rouen. But the
situation is pleasing. The skies are serene: the temperature is
mild, and the fruits of the earth are abundant and nutritious. Many
of the more respectable inhabitants expressed their surprise to me
that there were so few English resident in its neighbourhood--so
much preferable, on many accounts to that of Caen. But our
countrymen, you know, are sometimes a little capricious in the
objects of their choice. Just now, it is the <EM>fashion</EM> for
the English to reside at Caen; yet when you consider that the major
part of our countrymen reside there for the purpose of educating
their children--and that Caen, from its numerous seminaries of
education, contains masters of every description, whose lessons are
sometimes as low as a frank for each--it is not surprising that
Falaise is deserted for the former place. For myself-- and for all
those who love a select society, a sweet country, and rather a
plentiful sprinkle of antiquarian art,--for such, in short, who
would read the fabliaux of the old Norman bards in peace, comfort,
and silence--there can be no question about the preference to be
given to the spot from which I send this my last Norman
despatch.</P>

<P>I have before made mention of the fountains in this place. They
are equally numerous and clear. The inn in which we reside has not
fewer than three fountains--or rather of <EM>jets
d&#39;eau</EM>--constantly playing. Those in the <EM>Place St.
Trinité Grand Rue</EM>, and <EM>Place St. Gervais</EM>, are the
largest; but every gutter trickles with water as if dissolved from
the purest crystal. It has been hot weather during the greater part
of our stay; and the very sight of these translucent streams seems
to refresh one&#39;s languid frame. But I proceed chiefly to the
productions of the PRESS. They do a good deal of business here in
the way of ephemeral publications. Letellier, situated in the
Grande Rue, is the chief printer of <EM>chap books</EM>: and if we
judge from the general character of these, the <EM>Falaisois</EM>
seem to be marvellously addicted to the effusions of the muse.
Indeed, their ballads, of all kinds, are innumerable. Read a few--
which are to be found in the very commonest publications. There is
something rather original, and of a very pleasingly tender cast, in
the first two:</P>

<P>You must know that they are here great lovers of royalty, and of
course great supporters of the Bourbon Family. The King&#39;s
printer is a Mons. BRÉE l&#39;Ainé. He is a very pleasant,
well-bred man, and lives in the <EM>Place Trinité</EM>. I have paid
him more than one visit, and always felt additional pleasure at
every repetition of it. My first visit was marked with a somewhat
ludicrous circumstance. On entering the compositors&#39; room, I
observed, pasted upon the walls, in large capital letters, the
following well known words:</P>

<P class="quote">GOD SAVE THE KING.</P>

<P>Both Monsieur Brée l&#39;Ainé--and his workmen were equally
gratified by my notice and commendation of this sentiment. &quot;It
is the favourite sentiment, Sir, of your country,&quot;--remarked
the master. To this I readily assented. &quot;It is also, Sir, the
favourite one of our own,&quot; replied M. Brée l&#39;Ainé-- and
his men readily attested their concurrence in the same reply.
&quot;Ah, Sir, if you would only favour us by <EM>singing the
air</EM>, to which these words belong, you would infinitely oblige
us all&quot; ... said a shrewd and intelligent-looking compositor.
&quot;With all my heart&quot;--rejoined I--&quot;but I must frankly
tell you, that I shall sing it rather with heart than with
voice--being neither a vocal nor an instrumental performer.&quot;
&quot;No matter: give us only a notion of it.&quot; They all stood
round in a circle, and I got through two stanzas as gravely and as
efficiently as I was able. The usual &quot;charmant!&quot; followed
my exertions. It was now my turn to ask a favour. &quot;Sing to me
your favourite national air of ROBERT and ARLETTE.&quot; &quot;Most
willingly, Sir,&quot; replied the forementioned &quot;shrewd and
intelligent-looking compositor.&quot; &quot;Tenez: un petit moment:
je vais chercher mon violon. Ca ira mieux.&quot;</P>

<P>He left the house in search of his violin. The tune of the
National air which he sung was both agreeable and lively: and upon
the whole it was difficult to say which seemed to be the better
pleased with the respective national airs. M. Brée shewed me his
premises in detail. They had been formerly a portion of an old
church; and are situated on the edge of the great fosse which
encircles the town. A garden, full of sweet blooming flowers, is
behind them; and the view backwards is cheerful and picturesque.
There are generally five presses at work; which, for a provincial
printing office, shews business to be far from slack. Mons. B.
sells a great number of almanacks, and prints all the leading
publications connected with the town. In fact, his title, as
<EM>Imprimeur du Roi</EM>, supposes him to take the principal lead
as a printer. This agreeable man has a brother who is professor of
rhetoric in the Collège Royale at Paris.</P>

<P>Of <EM>Bouquinistes</EM>, or dealers in old books, there are
scarcely any. I spent three or four fruitless hours in a search
after old chronicles and old poetry: and was compelled, almost from
pure civility, to purchase of DUFOURS a <EM>Petit&#39;s Virgil</EM>
of 1529, folio--which will be hardly worth the carriage. I tried
hard for a fine copy of <EM>Fauchet&#39;s Origines de la Poésie
Françoise</EM>, 1581, 4to. with the head of the author, but in
vain; yet endeavoured to console myself by an old blue morocco copy
of <EM>Les regrets et tristes lamentations du Comte de
Montgomery</EM>, by <EM>Demorenne</EM>, Rouen, 1574, 8vo. as well
as a clean, fresh, and almost crackling copy of <EM>Amoureuses
occupations de la Taysonniere</EM>, Lyon, 1555, 8vo.--for two
francs each--and both destined for the rich and choice library of
our friend....</P>

<P>Thus much for FALAISE: for a spot, which, from the uniform
serenity of the weather since I have been here--from the comfort of
the inn--from the extreme civility and attention of the
townspeople--and from the yet more interesting society of the Comte
de la Fresnaye, the <EM>Curés</EM> Mouton and Langevin--together
with the amenity of the surrounding country, and the interesting
and in part magnificent remains of antiquity--can never be erased
from my recollection. It is here that the tourist and antiquary may
find objects for admiration and materials for recording. I have
done both: admired and recorded--happy, if the result of such
occupations shall have contributed to the substantial gratification
of yourself and of our common friends. And now, farewell; not only
to Falaise, but to NORMANDY. I shall leave it, from this delightful
spot, in the most thorough good humour, and with more than ordinary
regret that my stay has necessarily been short. I have taken my
place in the Diligence, direct for PARIS. &quot;Il n&#39;y a
qu&#39;un Paris&quot;--said the Comte de la Fresnaye to me the
other day, when I told him I had never been there--to which I
replied, &quot;Are there then TWO Londons?&quot; Thirty-six hours
will settle all this. In the mean time, adieu.</P>

<P>&quot;Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.&quot;
They must be protacted miseries indeed which do not, at some period
or other, have something like a termination. I am here, then my
good friend--safe and sound at last; comfortably situated in a
boarding house, of which the mistress is an agreeable Englishwoman
and the master an intelligent Swiss. I have sauntered, gazed, and
wondered--and exchanged a thousand gracious civilities! I have
delivered my epistolary credentials: have shaken hands with
Monsieur Van Praet; have paced the suite of rooms in which the
renowned BIBLIOTHEQUE DU ROI is deposited: have traversed the
<EM>Thuileries</EM> and the <EM>Louvre</EM>; repeatedly
reconnoitred the <EM>Boulevards</EM>; viewed the gilt dome of the
<EM>Hôtel des Invalides</EM>, and the white flag upon the
bronze-pillar in the <EM>Place Vendome</EM>; seen crowds of our
countrymen at <EM>Meurice&#39;s</EM> and in the hotels about the
<EM>Rue de la Paix;</EM> partaken of the rival ices of
<EM>Tortoni</EM> and the <EM>Caffé des Mille Colonnes</EM>; bought
old French poetry at a Bouquiniste&#39;s: and drank Chambertin and
Champagne at the richly garnished table of our ----. These are what
may be called good <EM>foreground objects</EM> in the composition
of a Parisian picture. Now for the filling up of the canvas with
appropriate and harmonizing detail.</P>

<P>A second reflection corrects however the precipitancy of such a
proposal; for it cannot be, in this my <EM>first</EM> despatch,
that you are to receive any thing like an adequate notion of the
topics thus hastily thrown together on the first impulse of
Parisian inspiration. Wait patiently, therefore: and at least
admire the methodical precision of my narrative. My last letter
left me on the eve of departure from Falaise; and it is precisely
from that place that I take up the thread of my journal. We were to
leave it, as I told you, in the Diligence--on the evening of the
Sunday, immediately following the date of the despatch transmitted.
I shall have reason to remember that journey for many a day to
come; but, &quot;post varios casus, &amp;c.&quot; I am thankful to
find myself safely settled in my present comfortable abode. The
Sabbath, on the evening of which the Diligence usually starts for
Paris, happened to be a festival. Before dawn of day I heard
incessant juvenile voices beneath the window of my bedroom at the
Grand Turc; What might this mean? Between three and four, as the
day began to break, I rose, and approaching the window, saw, from
thence, a number of little boys and girls busied in making
artificial flower-beds and sand- borders, &amp;c. Their tongues and
their bodily movements were equally unintermitting. It was
impossible for a stranger to guess at the meaning of such a
proceeding; but, opening the window, I thought there could be no
harm in asking a very simple question--which I will confess to you
was put in rather an irritable manner on my part ... for I had been
annoyed by their labours for more than the last hour. &quot;What
are you about, there?&quot; I exclaimed --&quot;Ha, is it you
Sir?&quot; replied a little arch boy--mistaking me for some one
else. &quot;Yes, (resumed I) tell me what you are about
there?&quot; &quot;in truth, we are making <EM>Réposoirs</EM> for
the FETE-DIEU: the Host will pass this way by and bye. Is it not a
pretty thing, Sir?&quot; exclaimed a sweetly modulated female
voice. All my irritability was softened in a moment; and I was
instantly convinced that Solomon never delivered a wiser sentiment
than when he said--&quot;A soft answer turneth away wrath!&quot; I
admitted the prettiness of the thing without comprehending a
particle of it: and telling them to speak in a lower key, shut the
window, and sought my bed. But sleep had ceased to seek me: and the
little urchins, instead of lowering their voices, seemed to break
forth in a more general and incessant vociferation. In consequence,
I was almost feverish from restlessness--when the fille de chambre
announced that &quot;it was eight o&#39;clock, and the morning most
beautiful.&quot;</P>

<P>These <EM>réposoirs</EM> are of more importance than you are
aware of. They consist of little spots, or spaces in the streets,
garnished with flowers, and intersected by walks, marked with fine
gravel, in the centre of which the Host rests, on its passing to
and fro from the several parishes. When I rose to dress, I observed
the work of art--which had been in progress during the
night--perfectly complete. Passengers were forbidden to trespass by
pieces of string fastened to different parts by way of a fence--or,
whoever chose to walk within, considered themselves bound to
deposit a sous as the condition of gratifying their curiosity. Upon
the whole, this réposoir might be about sixteen feet square.
Towards eleven o&#39;clock the different religious ceremonies
began. On one side the noise of the drum, and the march of the
national guard, indicated that military mass was about to be
performed; on the other, the procession of priests, robed and
officiating--the elevation of banners--and the sonorous responses
of both laity and clergy--put the whole town into agitation, and
made every inmate of every mansion thrust his head out of window,
to gaze at the passing spectacle. We were among the latter
denomination of lookers on, and recognised, with no small
gratification, our clerical friends Messieurs Mouton, Langevin, and
the huge father confessor at Guibra, followed by a great number of
respectable citizens, among whom the Comte de la Fresnaye and his
amiable and intelligent son (recently married) made most
respectable figures; They approached the réposoir in question. The
priests, with the Host, took their station within it; silence
followed; one officiating clergyman then knelt down; shut, what
seemed to be, the wooden covers of a book,--with, considerable
violence--rose--turned round, and the procession being again put in
motion--the whole marched away to the church of the Holy
Trinity;--whither I followed it; and where I witnessed what I was
unable to comprehend, and what I should not feel much disposed to
imitate. But let every country be allowed to reverence and respect
its own particular religious ceremonies. We may endure what we
cannot commend ... and insult and disrespect are among the last
actions which a well regulated mind will shew in its treatment of
such matters. I should add, that these réposoirs, a few hours after
the performance of the ceremony just described, are
indiscriminately broken up: the flowers and the little sand banks
falling equally a prey to the winds and the feet of the
passenger.</P>

<P>Opposite to the inn was an hospital for the female sick. It had
been formerly an establishment of very considerable extent and
celebrity; but whether it was originally connected with the
hospital of the <EM>Léproserie de Saint Lasare</EM>, (about which
the Abbé Langevin&#39;s History of Falaise is rather curious) the
<EM>Hôtel-Dieu</EM>, or the <EM>Hôpital Général</EM>, I cannot take
upon me to pronounce. Certain it is, however, that this
establishment does great credit to those who have the conduct of
it. As foreigners, and particularly as Englishmen, we were
permitted to see the whole, without reserve. On my return from
witnessing the ceremony at the church of the Trinity, I visited
this hospital: my companion having resumed his graphic operations
before the Castle. I shall not easily forget the face and figure of
the matron. To a countenance of masculine feature, and masculine
complexion--including no ordinary growth of beard, of a raven
tint--she added a sturdy, squat, muscular figure--which, when put
into action, moved in a most decided manner. A large bunch of
massive keys was suspended from a girdle at her side; and her
dress, which was black, was rendered more characteristic and
striking, by the appearance of, what are yet called,
<EM>bustles</EM> above her hips. As she moved, the keys and the
floor seemed equally to shake beneath her steps. The elder Smirke
would have painted this severe Duenna-like looking matron with
inimitable force and truth. But ... she no sooner opened her mouth,
than all traits of severity vanished. Her voice was even musical,
and her &quot;façon de parler&quot; most gracious. She shewed me
the whole establishment with equal good humour and alertness; and I
don&#39;t know when I ever made such a number of bows (to the
several female patients in the wards) within such limited time and
space. The whole building has the air of a convent; and there were
several architectural relics, perhaps of the end of the fifteenth
century, which I only regretted were not of portable dimensions;
as, upon making enquiry, little objection seemed to be made to the
gratuitous disposal of them.</P>

<P>The hour for departure, after sun-set, having arrived, we were
summoned to the Diligence when, bidding adieu to the very worthy
host and hostess of the <EM>Grand Turc</EM>, (whom I strongly
recommend all Englishmen to visit) I made up my mind for a
thirty-six hour&#39;s journey--as I was to reach Paris on Tuesday
morning. The day had been excessively hot for the season of the
year; and the night air was refreshing. But after a few snatches of
sleep-- greatly needed--there appeared manifest symptoms of decay
and downfall in the gloomy and comfortless machine in which we took
our departure. In other words, towards daylight, and just as we
approached <EM>L&#39;Aigle</EM>, the left braces (which proved to
be thoroughly rotted leather) broke in two: and down slid, rather
than tumbled, the Falaise Diligence! There were two French
gentlemen, and an elderly lady, besides ourselves in the coach.
While we halted, in order to repair the machine, the Frenchmen
found consolation in their misfortune by running to a caffé, (it
was between four and five in the morning), rousing the master and
mistress, and as I thought, peremptorily and impertinently asking
for coffee: while they amused themselves with billiards during its
preparation. I was in no humour for eating, drinking, or playing:
for here was a second sleepless night! Having repaired this crazy
vehicle, we rumbled on for <EM>Verneuil</EM>; where it was
exchanged for a diligence of more capacious dimensions. Here, about
eleven o&#39;clock, we had breakfast; and from henceforth let it
not be said that the art of eating and drinking belongs exclusively
to our country:--for such manifestations of appetite, and of attack
upon substantials as well as fluids, I had scarcely ever before
witnessed. I was well contented with coffee, tea, eggs, and
bread--as who might not well be?... but my companions, after taking
these in flank, cut through the centre of a roast fowl and a dish
of stewed veal: making diversions, in the mean while, upon sundry
bottles of red and white wine; the fingers, during the meal, being
as instrumental as the white metal forks.</P>

<P>We set off at a good round trot for <EM>Dreux</EM>: and, in the
route thither, we ascended a long and steep hill, having
<EM>Nonancourt</EM> to the left. Here we saw some very pretty
country houses, and the whole landscape had an air of English
comfort and picturesque beauty about it. Here, too, for the first
time, I saw a VINEYARD. At this early season of the year it has a
most stiff and unseemly look; presenting to the eye scarcely any
thing but the brown sticks, obliquely put into the ground, against
which the vine is trained. But the sloping banks, on each side of
the ascending road, were covered with plantations of this precious
tree; and I was told that, if the <EM>autumn</EM> should prove as
auspicious as appeared the <EM>spring</EM>, there would be a season
of equal gaiety and abundance. I wished it with all my heart.
Indeed I felt particularly interested in the whole aspect of the
country about <EM>Nonancourt</EM>. The sun was fast descending as
we entered the town of <EM>Dreux</EM>--where I had resolved upon
taking leave both of the diligence and of my companions; and of
reaching Paris by post. At seven we dined, or rather perhaps made
an early supper; when my fellow travellers <EM>sustained</EM> their
reputation for their powers of attack upon fish, flesh, and fowl.
Indeed the dinner was equally plentiful and well cooked; and the
charge moderate in proportion. But there is nothing, either on the
score of provision of reasonableness of cost, like the <EM>table
d&#39;hôte</EM> throughout France; and he who cannot accommodate
himself to the hour of dining (usually about one) must make up his
mind to worse fare and treble charges.</P>

<P>After dinner we strolled in the town, and upon the heights near
the castle. We visited the principal church, <EM>St. Jean</EM>,
which is very spacious, and upon the whole is a fine piece of
architecture. I speak more particularly of the interior--where I
witnessed, however, some of the most horrible devastations, arising
from the Revolution, which I had yet seen. In one of the side
chapels, there <EM>had been</EM> a magnificent monument; perhaps
from sixteen to twenty feet in height--crowded with figures as
large as life, from the base to the summit. It appeared as if some
trenchant instrument of an irresistible force, had shaved away many
of the figures; but more especially the heads and the arms. This
was only one, but the most striking, specimen of revolutionary
Vandalism. There were plenty of similar proofs, on a reduced scale.
In the midst of these traces of recent havoc, there was a pleasure
mingled with melancholy, in looking up and viewing some exceedingly
pretty specimens of old stained glass:--which had escaped the
destruction committed in the lower regions, and had preserved all
their original freshness. Here and there, in the side chapels, the
priests were robing themselves to attend confession; while the
suppliants, in kneeling attitudes, were expecting them by the side
of the confessionals. From the church I bent my steps to the
principal bookseller of the place, whom I found to be an
intelligent, civil, and extremely good- natured tradesman. But his
stock was too modern. &quot;Donnez vous la peine de
monter&quot;--exclaimed he precipitately; begging me to follow him.
His up- stairs collection was scarcely of a more ancient character
than that below. There were more copies of <EM>Voltaire</EM> and
<EM>Rousseau</EM> than I should have supposed he could sell in six
years--but &quot;on the contrary&quot; (said he) &quot;in six
months&#39; time, not a single copy will remain unsold!&quot; I
marvelled and grieved at such intelligence; because the poison was
not extracted from the nourishment contained in these works. To an
enquiry about my old typographical friends, <EM>Verard,
Pigouchet</EM>, and <EM>Eustace</EM>, the worthy bibliopole replied
&quot;qu&#39;il n&#39;avoit jamais entendu parler de ces
gens-la!&quot; Again I marvelled; and having no temptation to
purchase, civilly wished him good evening.</P>

<P>Meanwhile Mr. L. had attained the castle heights, and was lost
in a sort of extacy at the surrounding scene. On entering the outer
walls, and directing your steps towards the summit, you are
enchanted with a beautiful architectural specimen--in the character
of a zigzag early Norman arch-- which had originally belonged to a
small church, recently taken down: The arch alone stands insulated
... beyond which, a new, and apparently a very handsome, church is
erecting, chiefly under the care and at the expence of the present
Duke of Orleans;--as a mausoleum for his family--and in which, not
many days before our arrival, the remains of one of his children
had been deposited. I wished greatly for a perfect drawing of this
arch ... but there was no time ... and my companion was exercising
his pencil, on the summit, by a minute, bird&#39;s eye of the sweep
of country to be seen from this elevated situation--through the
greater part of which, indeed, the diligence from <EM>Verneuil</EM>
had recently conducted us. I should add, that not a relic of that
CASTLE, which had once kept the town and the adjacent country in
awe, is now to be seen: but its outer walls enclose a space hardly
less than twenty acres:--the most considerable area which I had yet
witnessed. To give a more interesting character to the scenery, the
sun, broad and red, was just hiding the lower limb of his disk
behind the edge of a purple hill. A quiet, mellow effect reigned
throughout the landscape. I gazed on all sides; and (wherefore, I
cannot now say) as I sunk upon the grass, overwhelmed with fatigue
and the lassitude of two sleepless nights, wished, in my heart, I
could have seen the effect of that glorious sun-set from, the
heights of Dover. Now and then, as when at school, one feels a
little home-sick; but the melancholy mood which then possessed me
was purely a physical effect from a physical cause. The shadows of
evening began to succeed to the glow of sun-set--when, starting
from my recumbent position, (in which sleep was beginning to
surprise me) I hastened down the heights, and by a nearer direction
sought the town and our hotel. We retired betimes to rest--but not
until, from an opposite coach maker, we had secured a phaeton-like
carriage to convey us with post horses, the next day, to Paris.</P>

<P>Excellent beds and undisturbed slumber put me in spirits for the
grand entrée into the metropolis of France. Breakfasting a little
after nine-- before ten, a pair of powerful black horses, one of
which was surmounted by a sprucely-attired postilion--with the
phaeton in the rear--were at the door of the hotel. Seeing all our
baggage properly secured, we sprung into the conveyance and darted
forward at a smart gallop. The animals seemed as if they could fly
away with us--and the whip of the postilion made innumerable
circular flourishes above their heads. The sky was beautifully
clear: and a briskly-stirring, but not unpleasantly penetrating,
south-east wind, played in our faces as we seemed scarcely to be
sensible of the road. What a contrast to the heat, vexation, and
general uncomfortableness of the two preceding days of our journey!
We felt it sensibly, and enjoyed it in proportion. Our first place
of halting, to change horses, was at HOUDAN; which may be about
four leagues from Dreux; and I verily believe we reached it in an
hour. The route thither is through a flat and uninteresting
country; except that every feature of landscape (and more
especially in our previous journeys through Normandy) seems to be
thrown to a greater distance, than in England. This may account for
the flatness of views, and the diminutiveness of objects. Houdan is
a village-like town, containing a population of about 2000
inhabitants; but much business is done on market days; and of
<EM>corn</EM>, in particular, I was told that they often sold
several thousand sacks in a day. Its contiguity to Paris may
account for the quantity of business done. In the outskirts of the
town,--and flanked, rather than surrounded, by two or three rows of
trees, of scarcely three years growth--stands the &quot;stiff and
stower&quot; remains of the <EM>Castle of Houdan</EM>. It is a very
interesting relic, and to our eyes appeared of an unusual
construction. The corner towers are small and circular; and the
intermediate portion of the outer wall is constructed with a swell,
or a small curvature outwards. I paced the outside, but have
forgotten the measurement. Certainly, it is not more than forty
feet square. I tried to gain admittance into the interior, but
without success, as the person possessing the key was not to be
found. I saw enough, however, to convince me that the walls could
not be less than twelve feet in thickness.</P>

<P>The horses had been some time in readiness, and the fresh
postilion seemed to be lost in amazement at the cause of our
loitering so long at so insignificant a place. The day warmed as we
pushed on for the far-famed &quot;proud Versailles.&quot; The
approach, from Houdan, is perhaps not the most favourable; although
we got peeps of the palace, which gave us rather elevated notions
of its enormous extent. We drove to the <EM>Hôtel de Bourbon</EM>,
an excellent, clean mansion, close to the very façade of the
palace, after passing the Hôtel de Ville; and from whence you have
an undisturbed view of the broad, wide, direct road to Paris. I
bespoke dinner, and prepared to lounge. The palace--of which I
purposely declined visiting the interior--reserving Versailles for
a future and entire day&#39;s gratification--is doubtless an
immense fabric--of which the façade just mentioned is composed of
brick, and assumes any thing but a grand and imposing air: merely
because it wants simplicity and uniformity of design. I observed
some charming white stone houses, scattered on each side of this
widely extended chaussée--or route royale--and, upon the whole,
Versailles appeared to us to be a magnificent and rather
interesting spot. Two or three rows of trees, some forty or fifty
generations more ancient than those constituting the boulevards at
Houdan, formed avenues on each side of this noble road; and all
appeared life and animation--savouring of the proximity of the
metropolis. Carriages without number--chiefly upon hire, were going
and returning; and the gaits and dresses of individuals were of a
more studied and of a gayer aspect. At length, we became a little
impatient for our dinner, and for the moment of our departure. We
hired one of these carriages; which for nine francs, would convey
us to the place of our destination. This appeared to me very
reasonable; and after being extravagant enough to drink Champagne
at dinner, to commemorate our near approach to the metropolis, we
set forward between five and six o&#39;clock, resolving to strain
our eyes to the utmost, and to be astonished at every thing we
saw!--especially as <EM>this</EM> is considered the most favourable
approach to the capital.</P>

<P>The <EM>Ecole Militaire</EM>, to the left, of which Marshal Ney
had once the chief command, struck me as a noble establishment. But
it was on approaching <EM>Sèvre</EM> that all the bustle and
population, attendant upon the immediate vicinity of a great
metropolis, became evident. Single-horsed vehicles--in many of
which not fewer than nine persons were pretty closely stowed--three
upon a bench, and three benches under the roof--fiacres, barouches,
and carriages of every description, among which we discovered a
great number from our own country--did not fail to occupy our
unremitting attention. <EM>Sèvre</EM> is a long, rambling, and
chiefly single-street town; but picturesquely situated, on a slope,
and ornamented to the left by the windings of the Seine. We were
downright glad to renew our acquaintance with our old, and
long-lost friend, the river Seine; although it appeared to be sadly
shorn of its majestic breadth since we had parted with it before
the walls of Montmorenci castle, in our route to Havre. The new
nine-arch bridge at Sèvre is a sort of Waterloo bridge in
miniature. Upon the heights, above it, I learnt that there was a
beautiful view of the river in the foreground with Paris in the
distance. We passed over the old bridge, and saw <EM>St. Cloud</EM>
to the left: which of course interested us as the late residence of
Bonaparte, but which, in truth, has nothing beyond the air of a
large respectable country-gentleman&#39;s mansion in England. We
pushed on, and began to have distinct perceptions of the great
city. Of all the desirable places of retreat, whether for its
elevated situation, or respectable appearance, or commodious
neighbourhood, nothing struck me more forcibly than the village of
PASSY, upon a commanding terrace, to the left; some three or four
English miles from Paris--and having a noble view both of the river
and of the city. It is also considered to be remarkably healthy;
and carriages of every description, are constantly passing thither
to and from Paris.</P>

<P>The dome of the <EM>Pantheon</EM>, and the gilded one of the
<EM>Hôtel des Invalides</EM>, together with the stunted towers of
<EM>Notre Dame</EM>, were among the chief objects to the right:
while the accompaniment of the Seine, afforded a pleasing
foreground to this architectural picture in the distance. But, my
friend, I will frankly own to you, that I was disappointed ... upon
this first glimpse of the GREAT city. In the first place, the
surrounding country is flat; with the exception of <EM>Mount
Calvary,</EM> to the left, which has nothing to do with the
metropolitan view from this situation. In the second place, what
are the <EM>Pantheon</EM> and <EM>Notre Dame</EM> compared with
<EM>St. Paul&#39;s</EM> and <EM>Westminster Abbey</EM>?--to say
nothing of the vicinity of London, as is connected with the
beautifully undulating ground about Camberwell, Sydenham, Norwood,
and. Shooter&#39;s Hill--and, on the other side of the water,
Hampstead, Highgate and Harrow: again, Wimbledon and Richmond!...
What lovely vicinities are these compared with that of <EM>Mont
Martre</EM>? And if you take river scenery into the account, what
is the <EM>Seine</EM>, in the neighbourhood of Paris, compared with
the <EM>Thames</EM> in that of London? If the almost impenetrable
smoke and filth from coal-fires were charmed away--shew me, I
beseech you, any view of Paris, from this, or from any point of
approach, which shall presume to bear the semblance of comparison
with that of London, from the descent from <EM>Shooter&#39;s
Hill</EM>! The most bewitched Frenchified-Englishman, in the
perfect possession of his eye sight, will not have the temerity to
institute such a comparison. But as you near the barriers, your
admiration increases. Having got rid of all background of
country--as you approach the capital--the foregoing objections
vanish. Here the officers of police affected to search our luggage.
They were heartily welcome, and so I told them. This disarmed all
suspicion. Accordingly we entered Paris by one of the noblest and
one of the most celebrated of its Boulevards--the <EM>Champs
Elysées</EM>. As we gained the <EM>Place Louis Quinze</EM>, with
the <EM>Thuileries</EM> in front, with the <EM>Hôtel des
Invalides</EM> (the gilded dome of which latter reflected the
strong rays of a setting sun) to the right--we were much struck
with this combination of architectural splendour: indisputably much
superior to any similar display on the entrance into our own
capital.<A name="fnref_174"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_174">174</A> Turning to the left, the <EM>Place Vendome</EM>
and the <EM>Rue de la Paix</EM>, with the extreme height of the
houses, and the stone materials of their construction, completed
our admiration. But the <EM>Boulevards Italiens</EM>--after passing
the pillars of the proposed church of <EM>Ste. Madelaine</EM>, and
turning to the right-- helped to prolong our extreme gratification,
till we reached the spot whence I am addressing you. Doubtless, at
first glance, this is a most splendid and enchanting city. A
particular detail must be necessarily reserved, for the next
despatch. I shall take all possible pains to make you acquainted
with the treasures of PAST TIMES--in the shape of Manuscripts and
printed Books. THE ROYAL LIBRARY has as much astonished me, as the
CURATORS of it have charmed me by their extreme kindness and
civility.<A name="fnref_175"></A><A class="fnref" href=

<H2 class="letter">SUPPLEMENT TO VOL. I.</H2>

<H3 class="centered">OLD POEM ON THE SIEGE OF ROUEN.</H3>

<P>The city of Rouen makes too considerable a figure in the
foregoing pages, and its history, as connected with our own country
in the earlier part of the fifteenth century, is too interesting,
to require any thing in the shape of apology for the matter which
the Reader is about to peruse. This &quot;matter&quot; is
necessarily incidental to the <EM>present</EM> edition of the
&quot;Tour;&quot; as it is only recently made public. An
&quot;<EM>Old English Poem</EM>&quot; on our Henry the Fifth&#39;s
&quot;<EM>Siege of Rouen</EM>&quot; is a theme likely to excite the
attention of the literary Antiquary on <EM>either</EM> side of the
Channel.</P>

<P>The late erudite, and ever to be lamented Rev. J.J. Conybeare,
successively Professor of the Saxon language, and of English Poetry
in the University of Oxford, discovered, in the exhaustless
treasures of the Bodleian Library, a portion of the Old English
Poem in question: but it was a portion only. In the 21st. vol. of
the Archæologia, Mr. Conybeare gave an account of this fortunate
discovery, and subjoined the poetical fragment. Mr. Frederick
Madden, one of the Librarians attached to the MS. department in the
British Museum, was perhaps yet more fortunate in the discovery of
the portion which was lost: and in the 22d. vol. of the
<EM>Archæologia</EM>, just published, (pp. 350-398), he has annexed
an abstract of the remaining fragment, with copious and learned
notes. This fragment had found its way, in a prose attire, into the
well-known English MS. Chronicle, called the BRUTE:--usually (but
most absurdly) attributed to Caxton. It is not however to be found
in <EM>all</EM> the copies of this Chronicle. On the contrary, Mr.
Madden, after an examination of several copies of this MS. has
found the poem only in four of them: namely, in two among the
Harleian MSS. (Nos. 753; 2256--from which <EM>his</EM> transcript
and collation have been made) in one belonging to Mr. Coke of
Holkham, and in a fourth belonging to the <EM>Cotton</EM>
Collection:--Galba E. viii. This latter MS. has a very close
correspondence with the <EM>second</EM> Harl. MS. but is often
faulty from errors of the Scribe, See <EM>Gentleman&#39;s Magazine,
May</EM>, 1829.</P>

<P>So much for the history of the discovery of this precious old
English Poem--which is allowed to be a contemporaneous production
of the time of the Siege--namely, A.D. 1418. A word as to its
intrinsic worth--from the testimony of the Critic most competent to
appreciate it. &quot;It will be admitted, I believe, (says Mr.
Madden) by all who will take the trouble to compare the various
contemporary narratives of the Siege of Rouen, that in point of
simplicity, clearness, and minuteness of detail, there is NO
existing document which can COMPARE with the Poem before us. Its
authenticity is sufficiently established, from the fact of the
Author&#39;s having been an EYEWITNESS of the whole. If we review
the names of those Historians who lived at the same period, we
shall have abundant reason to rejoice at so valuable an accession
to our present stock of information on the subject.&quot;
<EM>Archæologia</EM>, vol. xxii. p. 353. The reader shall be no
longer detained from a specimen or two of the poem itself, which
should seem fully to justify the eulogy of the Critic.</P>

<P>&quot;On the day after the return of the twelve delegates sent
by the City of Rouen to treat with Henry, the Poet proceeds to
inform us, that the King caused two tents to be pitched, one for
the English Commissioners, and the other for the French. On the
English side were appointed the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of
Salisbury, the Lord Fitzhugh, and Sir Walter Hungerford, and on the
French side, twelve discreet persons were chosen to meet them. Then
says the writer,</P>

<P class="poetry">&#39;It was a sight of solempnity,<BR>
 For to behold both party;<BR>
 To see the rich in their array,<BR>
 And on the walls the people that lay,<BR>
 And on our people that were without,<BR>
 How thick that they walked about;<BR>
 And the heraudis seemly to seene,<BR>
 How that they went ay between;<BR>
 The king&#39;s heraudis and pursuivants,<BR>
 In coats of arms <EM>amyantis</EM>.<BR>
 The English a beast, the French a flower,<BR>
 Of Portyngale both castle and tower,<BR>
 And other coats of diversity,<BR>
 As lords bearen in their degree.&#39;</P>

<P>&quot;As a striking contrast to this display of pomp and
splendour is described the deplorable condition of those
unfortunate inhabitants who lay starving in the ditches without the
walls of the City, deprived both of food and clothing. The
affecting and simple relation of our Poet, who was an eye- witness,
is written with that display of feeling such a scene must naturally
have excited, and affords perhaps one of the most favourable
passages in the Poem to compare with the studied narratives of
Elmham or Livius. In the first instance we behold misery literally
in rags, and hiding herself in silence and obscurity, whilst in the
other she is ostentatiously paraded before our eyes:</P>

<P class="poetry">&#39;There men might see a great pity,<BR>
 A child of two year or three<BR>
 Go about, and bid his bread,<BR>
 For Father and mother both lay dead,<BR>
 And under them the water stood,<BR>
 And yet they lay crying after food.<BR>
 Some <EM>storven</EM> to the death,<BR>
 And some stopped both eyen and breath,<BR>
 And some crooked in the knees,<BR>
 And as lean as any trees,<BR>
 And women holding in their arm<BR>
 A dead child, and nothing warm,<BR>
 And children sucking on the pap<BR>
 Within a dead woman&#39;s lap.&#39;</P>

<P>On Friday the 20th of January, King Henry V. made his public
entry into Rouen. His personal appearance is thus described:</P>

<P class="poetry">&#39;He rode upon a brown steed,<BR>
 Of black damask was his weed,<BR>
 A <EM>Peytrelle</EM> of gold full bright<BR>
 About his neck hung down right,<BR>
 And a pendant behind him did honge<BR>
 Unto the earth, it was so long.<BR>
 And they that never before him did see,<BR>
 They knew by the cheer which was he.&#39;</P>

<P>&quot;With the accustomed, but mistaken, piety for which Henry
was ever distinguished, he first proceeded to the monastery, where
he alighted from his charger, and was met by the chaplains of his
household, who walked before him, chanting <EM>Quis est magnus
Dominus?</EM> After the celebration of mass, the king repaired to
the Castle, where he took up his abode. By this termination of a
siege, which, for its duration and the horrors it produced, is
perhaps without a parallel in ancient or modern times, the city was
again plentifully supplied with provisions, and recovered the shock
so tedious and afflicting a contest had occasioned:</P>

<P class="poetry">&#39;And thus our gracious liege<BR>
 Made an end of his siege;<BR>
 And all that have heard this reading,<BR>
 To his bliss Christ you bring,<BR>
 That for us died upon a tree,<BR>
 Amen say we all, <EM>pur charite!</EM>&#39;</P>

<P>The Duke of Exeter is appointed Governor of the City, and
ordered by Henry to take possession of it the same night. The Duke
mounts his horse, and rides strait to the Port de Bevesyne or
Beauvais, attended by a retinue, to carry the commands of his
sovereign into execution. His Entré, and the truly miserable
condition of the besieged, together with the imposing appearance of
Henry, shall now be described in the language of the poet.</P>

<P>This account is confirmed by MS. Harl. 2258, and Lansd. 225. f.
431. as quoted by Mr. Nicholas, in the Retrosp. Rev. vol. i. N.S.
The former of these MSS. states: Euery standard and
<EM>Guydhome</EM> [whence the etymology of the word is obvious] to
have in the chief the crosse of St. George, to be slitte at the
ende, and to conteyne the creste or supporter, with the posey,
worde, and devise of the owner.&quot; It adds, that &quot;a
guydhome must be two yardes and a halfe, or three yardes
longe.&quot; This rule may sometimes have been neglected, at least
by artists, for in a bill of expences for the Earl of Warwick,
dated July 1437, and printed by Dugdale, (Warw. p. 327.) we find
the following entry; &quot;Item, a <EM>gyton</EM> for the shippe of

name="fnref_176"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_176">176</A>
containing an archaeological description of this Statue by M.
Revet, and a scientific account of its component parts, by M.
Houton La Billardière, Professor of Chemistry at Rouen. The former
embodied his remarks in two letters addressed to the Prefect of the
Lower Seine. A print of the figure in its then extremely mutilated
state, is prefixed; but its omission would have been no great
drawback to the publication--which, in its details, appears to be
ingenious, learned, and satisfactory. The highest praise is given
to the Statue, as a work of art of the second century.<A name=
"fnref_177"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_177">177</A> Its
<EM>identity</EM> seems to be yet a subject of disputation:--but M.
Revet considers it as &quot;the representation of some idolatrous
divinity.&quot; The opinion of its being a representation of
Bacchus, or of Apollo, or of a Constellation, he thinks might be
regulated by a discovery of some emblem, or attribute, found in the
vicinity of the Statue. Two other plates--lithographised--relating
to explanations of the pieces of the Statue, close this interesting
performance.</P>

<DIV class="footnote">
<P><A name="fn_1"></A><A href="#fnref_1">1</A> M. Crapelet is of
course speaking of the PREVIOUS edition of the Tour. He continues
thus: &quot;M. Dibdin, dans son voyage en France, a visité nos
départemens de l&#39;ouest et de l&#39;est, toutes leurs
principales villes, presque tous les lieux remarquables par les
antiquités, par les monumens, par les beautés du site, ou par les
souvenirs historiques. Il a visité les châteaux, les églises, les
chapelles; il a observé nos moeurs, nos coutumes; nos habitudes; il
a examiné nos Musées et nos premiers Cabinets de curiosité; il
s&#39;est concentré dans nos Bibliothéques. Il parle de notre
littérature et des hommes de lettres, des arts et de nos artistes;
il critique les personnes comme les choses; il loue quelquefois, il
plaisante souvent; la vivacité de son esprit l&#39;égare presque
toujours.&quot; A careful perusal of the notes in THIS edition will
shew that my veracity has not &quot;almost always led me
astray.&quot;</P>

<P><A name="fn_4"></A><A href="#fnref_4">4</A> It is a little
curious that M. Lesné has not been singular in this supposition. My
amiable and excellent friend M. Schweighæuser of Strasbourg had the
same notion: at least, he told me that the style of the Tour very
frequently reminded him of that of Sterne. I can only say--and say
very honestly--that I as much thought of Sterne as I did of ...
William Caxton!</P>

<P><A name="fn_5"></A><A href="#fnref_5">5</A> Copious as are the
above quotations, from the thoroughly original M. Lesné, I cannot
resist the risking of the readers patience and good opinion, by the
subjoining of the following passage--with which the brochure
concludes. &quot;D&#39;après la multitude de choses hasardées que
contient votre Lettre, vous en aurez probablement recu quelques
unes de personnes que vous aurez choquées plus que moi, qui vous
devrais plutôt des remercimens pour avoir pris la peine de traduire
quelques pages de mon ouvrage; mais il n&#39;en est pas de même de
bien des gens, et cela ne doit pas les engager à être autant
communicatif avec vous, si vous reveniez en France. Je souhaite,
dans ce dernier cas, que tous les typographes, les bibliothècaires,
les bibliognostes, les bibliographes, les bibliolathes, les
bibliomanes, les biblophiles, les bibliopoles, ceux qui exercent la
bibliuguiancie et les bibliopégistes même, soient pour vous autant
de bibliotaphes; vous ne seriez plus à même de critiquer ce que
vous sauriez et ce que vous ne sauriez pas, comme vous l&#39;aviez
si souvent fait inconsidérément:</P>

<P class="poetry">Mais tous vos procédés ne nous étonnent pas,<BR>
C&#39;est le sort des Français de faire DES INGRATS;<BR>
On les voit servir ceux qui leur furent nuisibles;<BR>
Je crois que sur ce point ils sont incorrigibles.</P>

<P>Je vous avouerai cependant que je suis loin d&#39;être fâché de
vous voir en agir ainsi envers mes compatriotes: je désirerais que
beaucoup d&#39;Anglais fissent de même; cela pourrait désangliciser
ou désanglomaniser les Français. Vous, Monsieur, qui aimez les mots
nouveaux, aidez-moi, je vous prie, à franciser, à purifier
celui-ci. Quant à moi</P>

<P class="poetry">Je ne fus pas nourri de Grec et de Latin,<BR>
J&#39;appris à veiller tard, à me lever matin,<BR>
La nature est le livre où je fis mes études,<BR>
Et tous ces mots nouveaux me semblent long-temps rudes;<BR>
Je trouve qu&#39;on ne peut très bien les prononcer<BR>
Sans affectation, au moins sans grimacer;<BR>
Que tous ces mots tirés des langues étrangères,<BR>
Devraient être l&#39;objet de critiques sévères.<BR>
Faites donc de l&#39;esprit en depit du bon sens,<BR>
On vous critiquera; quant à moi j&#39;y consens.</P>

<P>Je terminerai cette longue Lettre de deux manières: à
l&#39;anglaise, en vous souhaitant le bon jour ou le bon soir,
suivant l&#39;heure à laquelle vous la recevrez; à la française, en
vous priant de me croire,</P>

<P><A name="fn_6"></A><A href="#fnref_6">6</A> The above brochure
consists of two Letters; each to an anonymous bibliographical
&quot;Confrere:&quot; one is upon the subject of M. Crapelet&#39;s
version--the other, upon that of M. Licquet&#39;s version--of a
portion of the Tour. The notice of the Works of the Author of the
Tour; a list of the prices for which the Books mentioned in it have
been sold; a Notice of the &quot;Hours of Charlemagne&quot; (see
vol. ii. 199) and some account of the late Mr. Porson
&quot;Librarian of the London Institution&quot;--form the remaining
portion of this little volume of about 160 pages. For the
&quot;Curiosités Bibliographiques,&quot; consult the

<P><A name="fn_7"></A><A href="#fnref_7">7</A> This letter
accompanied another Work of M. Peignot, relating to editions and
translations of the Roman Classics:--and as the reader will find,
in the ensuing pages, that I have been sometime past labouring
under the frightful, but popular, mania of AUTOGRAPHS, I subjoin
with no small satisfaction a fac-simile of the Autograph of this
enthusiastic and most diligent Bibliographer.</P>

<P><A name="fn_9"></A><A href="#fnref_9">9</A> M. Licquet goes on
to afford an exemplification of this precipitancy of conjecture, in
my having construed the word <EM>Allemagne</EM>--a village near to
Caen--by that of <EM>Germany</EM>. I refer the reader to p. 168
post, to shew with what perfect frankness I have admitted and
corrected this &quot;<EM>hippopotamos</EM>&quot; error.</P>

admission of my bitterest annotator, M. Crapelet, that &quot;I

253. It is painful and unusual with me to have recourse to such
apparently self-complimentary language; but when an adversary

Antiquaries have pushed the antiquity of this castle to the 11th
century, supposing it to have been built by <EM>William
d&#39;Arques</EM>, Count of Tallon, son of the second marriage of
Richard Duke of Normandy. I make no doubt, that, whenever built,
the sea almost washed its base: for it is known to have occupied
the whole of what is called the <EM>Valley of Arques</EM>, running
as far as <EM>Bouteilles</EM>. Its position, in reference to the
art of war, must have been almost impregnable. Other hypotheses
assign its origin to the ninth or tenth century. Whenever built,
its history has been fertile in sieges. In 1144, it was commanded
by a Flemish Monk, who preferred the spear to the crosier, but who
perished by an arrow in the contest. Of its history, up to the
sixteenth century, I am not able to give any details; but in the
wars of Henry IV. with the League, in 1589, it was taken by
surprise by soldiers in the disguise of sailors: who, killing the
centinels, quickly made themselves masters of the place. Henry
caused it afterwards to be dismantled. In the first half of the
eighteenth century it received very severe treatment from pillage,
for the purpose of erecting public and private buildings at Dieppe.

published an account of it, together with some views (indifferently

Second of France. Henry however endeavoured to compensate for his
indiscretions by the pomp and splendor of his processions. Rouen,
so celebrated of old for the entries of Kings and Nobles, seems to
have been in a perfect blaze of splendor upon that of the Lover of

citizens--(with their gorgeous accoutrements of white plumes,
velvet hats, rich brocades, and curiously wrought taffetas) of whom
the processions were composed. It must have been a perfectly
dramatic sight, upon the largest possible scale. It was from
respect to the character or the memory of DIANA, that so many

the late <EM>Marché des Veaux</EM>. It was however not half a
stone&#39;s throw from the site of the present statue. In the
<EM>Antiquités Nationales</EM> of the last mentioned author (vol.
iii. art. xxxvi.) there are three plates connected with the History
of JOAN of ARC. The <EM>first</EM> plate represents the <EM>Porte
Bouvreuil</EM> to the left, and the circular old tower to the
right--in which latter Joan was confined, with some houses before
it; the middle ground is a complete representation of the
rubbishing state by which many of the public buildings at Rouen are
yet surrounded; and French taste has enlivened the foreground with
a picture of a lover and his mistress, in a bocage, regaling
themselves with a flagon of wine. The old circular tower (&quot;qui
vit gémir cette infortunée,&quot; says Millin) exists no longer.
The second plate represents the fountain which was built in the
market-place upon the very spot where the Maid suffered, and which
spot was at first designated by the erection of a cross. From the
style of the embellishments it appears to have been of the time of
Francis I.</P>

<P>Goube has re-engraved this fountain. It was taken down or
demolished in 1755; upon the site of which was built the present
tasteless production-- resembling, as the author of the
<EM>Itinéraire de Rouen</EM> (p. 69) well observes, &quot;rather a
Pallas than the heroine of Orleans.&quot; The name of the author
was STODTS. Millin&#39;s <EM>third</EM> plate--of this present
existing fountain, is desirable; in as much as it shews the front
of the house, in the interior of which are the basso-rilievos of
the <EM>Champ de drap d&#39;Or</EM>: for an account of which see
afterwards.</P>

<P>Millin allows that all PORTRAITS of her--whether in sculpture,
or painting, or engraving--are purely IDEAL. Perhaps the nearest,
in point of fidelity, was that which was seen in a painted glass
window of the church of the <EM>Minimes</EM> at Chaillot: although
the building was not erected till the time of Charles VIII. Yet it
might have been a copy of some coeval production. In regard to oil
paintings, I take it that the portrait of JUDITH, with a sword in
one hand, and the head of Holofernes in the other, has been usually
copied (with the omission of the latter accompaniment) as that of
JEANNE D&#39;ARC. I hardly know a more interesting collection of
books than that which may be acquired respecting the fate of this
equally brave and unfortunate heroine.</P>

<P><A name="fn_63"></A><A href="#fnref_63">63</A> Far be it from me
to depreciate the labours of Montfaucon. But those who have not the
means of getting at that learned antiquarian&#39;s <EM>Monarchie
Françoise</EM> may possibly have an opportunity of examining
precisely the same representations, of the procession above alluded
to, in <EM>Ducarel&#39;s Anglo-Norman Antiquities</EM>, Plate XII.
Till the year 1726 this extraordinary series of ornament was
supposed to represent the <EM>Council of Trent</EM>; but the Abbé
Noel, happening to find a salamander marked upon the back of one of
the figures, supposed, with greater truth, that it was a
representation of the abovementioned procession; and accordingly
sent Montfaucon an account of the whole. The Abbé might have found
more than one, two, or three salamanders, if he had looked closely
into this extraordinary exterior; and possibly, in his time, the
surfaces of the more delicate parts, especially of the human
features, might not have sustained the injuries which time and
accident now seem to have inflicted on them. [A beautiful effort in
the graphic way representing the entire interior front of this
interesting mansion, is said to be published at Rouen.]</P>

<P><A name="fn_64"></A><A href="#fnref_64">64</A> In the previous

of this bas-relief, representing--as I imagine--the setting out of
Francis to meet Henry. Nothing, as far as correctness of detail
goes, can give a more faithful resemblance of the PRECISE STATE in
which the original appears: the defaced and the entire parts being
represented with equal fidelity. Mons. Langlois has given a plate
of the entire façade or front--in outline--with great ability; but
so small as to give little or no notion of the character of the
original.</P>

<P><A name="fn_77"></A><A href="#fnref_77">77</A> [The omission, in
this place, of the entire IXth Letter, relating to the PUBLIC
LIBRARY at Rouen, must be accounted for, and it is hoped, approved,
on the principle laid down at the outset of this undertaking;
namely, to omit much that was purely bibliographical, and of a
secondary interest to the general Reader. The bibliography, in the
original IXth Letter, being of a partial and comparatively dry
description--as relating almost entirely to ancient volumes of
Church Rituals--was thought to be better omitted than abridged.
Another reason might be successfully urged for its omission.</P>

<P>This IXth Letter, which comprehends 22 pages in the previous
impression, and about 38 pages in the version, having been
translated and <EM>separately</EM> published in 1821, by Mons.
Licquet (who succeeded M. Gourdin as Principal Librarian of the
Library in question) I had bestowed upon it particular attention,
and entered into several points by way of answer to his remarks,
and in justification or explanation of the original matter. In
consequence, any <EM>abridgement</EM> of that original matter must
have led to constant notice of the minute remarks, and pigmy
attacks, of my critical translator: and the stream of intelligence
in the text might have been diverted, or rendered unpalatable, by
the observations, in the way of controversy, in the notes. If M.
Licquet considers this avowal as the proclaiming of his triumph, he
is welcome to the laurels of a Conqueror; but if he can persuade
any COMMON FRIENDS that, in the translation here referred to, he
has defeated the original author in one essential position- -or
corrected him in one flagrant inaccuracy--I shall be as prompt to
thank him for his labours, as I am now to express my astonishment
and pity at his undertaking. When M. Licquet put forth the brochure
in question--(so splendidly executed in the press of M.
Crapelet--to harmonise, in all respects, with the large paper
copies of the original English text) he had but recently occupied
the seat of his Predecessor. I can commend the zeal of the
newly-appointed Librarian in Chief; but must be permitted to
question alike his judgment and his motives.</P>

<P>One more brief remark in this place. My translator should seem
to commend what is only laudatory, in the original author,
respecting his countrymen. Sensitively alive to the notice of their
smallest defects, he has the most unbounded powers of digestion for
that of their excellences. Thus, at the foot of the ABOVE PASSAGE,
in the text, Mons. Licquet is pleased to add as follows--in a note:
&quot;Si M. Dibdin ne s&#39;était livré qu&#39;à des digressions de
cette nature, il aurait trouvé en France un chorus universel, un
concert de voeux unanimes:&quot; vol. i. p. 239. And yet few

beautifully carved in stone, and continued to the very summit of

interior length is about 250 feet by 72 of width. The central aisle

the capitals of which represent vine leaves and other decorations,
more fanciful, and not less rich, than the Corinthian acanthus....

original architect of this church. It consists of a small skeleton,
drawn in black lines, against a tablet in the wall: a mason&#39;s

<P><A name="fn_88"></A><A href="#fnref_88">88</A> Small as may be
this village, and insignificant as may be its aspect, it is one of
the most important places, with respect to navigation, in the whole
course of the river Seine. Seven years ago there were not fewer
than <EM>four-score</EM> pilots settled here, by order of
government, for the purpose of guarding against accidents which
arise from a want of knowledge of the navigation of the river. In
time of peace this number would necessarily be increased. In the
year 1789 there were upwards of 250 English vessels which passed
it--averaging, in the whole, 19,000 tons. It is from
<EM>Quillebeuf</EM>to <EM>Havre</EM> that the accidents arise. The
author of a pompous, but very instructive memoir, &quot;<EM>sur la
Topographie et la Statistique de la Ville de Quillebeuf et de
l&#39;embouchure de la Seine, ayant pour objet-principal la
navigation et la pêché</EM>,&quot; (published in the Transactions
of the Rouen Society for the year 1812, and from which the
foregoing information has been obtained) mentions three or four
<EM>wrecks</EM> which have taken place in the immediate vicinity of
Quillebeuf: and it should seem that a <EM>calm</EM> is, of all
things, the most fatal. The currents are strong, and the vessel is
left to the mercy of the tides in consequence. There are also rocks
and sand banks in abundance. Among the wrecks, was one, in which a
young girl of eighteen years of age fell a victim to the ignorance
of the pilot. The vessel made a false tack between <EM>Hode</EM>
and <EM>Tancarville</EM>, and running upon a bank, was upset in an
instant. An English vessel once shared the same calamity. A thick
fog suddenly came on, when the sloop ran upon a bank near the
<EM>Nez de Tancarville</EM>, and the crew had just time to throw
themselves into the boat and escape destruction. The next morning,
so sudden and so decisive was the change wrought by the sand and
current, that, of the sloop, there remained, at ebb-tide, only ten
feet of her mast visible! It appears that the <EM>Quillebois</EM>,
owing to their detached situation, and their peculiar occupations,
speak a very barbarous French. They have a sort of sing-song method
of pronunciation; and the <EM>g</EM> and <EM>j</EM> are strangely
perverted by them. Consult the memoir here referred to; which
occupies forty octavo pages: and which forms a sequel to a previous
communication (in 1810) &quot;upon the Topography and Medical
properties of Quillebeuf and its adjacent parts.&quot; The author
is M. Boismare. His exordium is a specimen of the very worst

most happy results may be anticipated. It was in a neighbouring
property that an ANTIQUE BRONZE GILT STATUE, of the size of life,
was lately found,&quot; vol. i. 194. Of this statue, Mr. Samuel
Woodburn, (with that spirit of liberality and love of art which
have uniformly characterised his purchases) became the Owner. The
sum advanced for it was very considerable; but, in one sense, Mr.
W. may be said to have stood as the Representative of his country;
for the French Government declining to give the Proprietor the sum
which he asked, Mr. Woodburn purchased it--solely with the view of
depositing it, on the same terms of purchase, in a NATIONAL GALLERY
OF ART, of which the bequest of Mr. Payne Knight&#39;s ancient
bronzes and coins, and the purchase of Mr. Angerstein&#39;s
pictures, might be supposed to lay the foundation.</P>

<P>This statue was accordingly brought over to England, and freely
exhibited to the curious admirers of ancient art. It is the figure
of an APOLLO--the left arm, extended to hold the lyre, being
mutilated. A portion of the limbs is also mutilated; but the torso,
head and legs, are entire: and are, of their kind, of the highest
class of art. Overtures were made for its purchase by government.
The Trustees of the British Museum were unanimous both in their
admiration and recommendation of it: it was indeed &quot;strongly
recommended&quot; by them to the Treasury. Several months however
elapsed before an answer could be obtained; and that answer, when
it <EM>did</EM> come, was returned in THE NEGATIVE. The
disappointment of reasonably indulged hopes of success, was the
least thing felt by its owner. It was the necessity of transporting
it, in consequence, to enrich a <EM>rival capital</EM>--which, were
its means equal to its wishes and good taste, it must be confessed,

<P><A name="fn_101"></A><A href="#fnref_101">101</A> The fauxbourgs
of Caen, in the present day, wear a melancholy contrast to what
they appear to have done in the middle of the XVIth century.

the first topographer of the place, BOURGUEVILLE: in his

<P>It may be worth subjoining, from the same interesting authority,
that long after the time even of the publication just referred to,
the town of Caen was surrounded by lofty and thick stone
walls--upon the tops of which three men could walk a-breast: and
from thence the inhabitants could discern, across those large and
beautiful gardens, &quot;the vessels sailing in the river Orne, and
unloading their cargoes by the sides of walls.&quot; It appears
indeed to have been a sort of lounge, or fashionable promenade--by
means of various ladders for the purposes of ascent and
descent.</P>

<P>Among the old prints and bird&#39;s-eye views of Caen, which I
saw in the collection of DE BOZE at the Royal Library at Paris,
there is one accompanied by three pages of printed description,
which begins with the lines of Guillaume Breton &quot;Villa potens,
opulenta, situ spatiosa decora.&quot; See First Edition, vol. i. p.
274. Evelyn, in 1644, thus describes the town of Caen. &quot;The
whole town is handsomely built of that excellent stone so well
knowne by that name in England. I was lead to a pretty garden,
planted with hedges of Alaternus, having at the entrance, at an
exceeding height, accurately cut in topiary worke, with well
understood architecture, consisting of pillars, niches, freezes,
and other ornaments, with greate curiosity, &amp;c. <EM>Life and

and of the elevation of compartments of the Nave; The former is at

<P><A name="fn_109"></A><A href="#fnref_109">109</A> It should be
noticed that, &quot;besides the immense benefactions which William
in his life time conferred upon this abbey, he, on his death,
presented thereto the <EM>crown</EM> which he used to wear at all
high festivals, together with his <EM>sceptre and rod</EM>: a cup
set with precious stones; his candlesticks of gold, and all his
regalia: as also the ivory bugle-horn which usually hung at his
back.&quot; <EM>Anglo-Norman Antiquities</EM>, p. 51. note. The
story of the breaking open of the coffin by the Calvinists, and
finding the Conqueror&#39;s remains, is told by Bourgueville--who
was an <EM>eye witness</EM> of these depredations, and who tried to
&quot;soften the obdurate hearts&quot; of the pillagers, but in
vain. This contemporaneous historian observes that, in his time
&quot;the abbey was filled with beautiful and curious stained-glass
windows and harmonious organs, which were all broken and
destroyed--and that the seats, chairs, &amp;c. and all other wooden
materials were consumed by fire,&quot; p.171. Huet observes that a
&quot;Dom Jean de Baillehache and Dom Matthieu de la Dangie,&quot;
religious of St. Stephen&#39;s, took care of the monument of the
Conqueror in the year 1642, and replaced it in the state in which
it appeared in Huet&#39;s time.&quot; <EM>Origines de Caen</EM>;
p.248. The revolution was still more terrible than the Calvinistic
fury;--for no traces of the monument are now to be seen.</P>

<P><A name="fn_110"></A><A href="#fnref_110">110</A> The west
window is almost totally obscured by a most gigantic organ built
close to it, and allowed to be the finest in all France. This organ
is so big, as to require eleven large bellows, &amp;c.
<EM>Ducarel</EM>, p.57. He then goes on to observe, that
&quot;amongst the plate preserved in the treasury of this church,
is a curious SILVER SALVER, about ten inches in diameter, gilt, and
inlaid with antique medals. Tradition assures us, that it was on
this salver, that king William the conqueror placed the foundation
charter of the abbey when he presented it, at the high altar, on
the dedication of the church. The edges of this salver, which
stands on a foot stalk of the same metal, are a little turned up,
and carved. In the centre is inlaid a Greek medal; on the obverse
whereof is this legend,
<!-- [Greek: Ausander Aukonos] -->
&#913;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#949;&#961;
&#913;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;
but it being
fixed in its socket, the reverse is not visible. The other medals,
forty in number, are set round the rim, in holes punched quite
through; so that the edges of the holes serve as frames for the
medals. These medals are Roman, and in the highest
preservation.&quot;</P>

<P><A name="fn_111"></A><A href="#fnref_111">111</A> Yet
Bourgueville&#39;s description of the group, as it appeared in his
time, trips up the heels of his own conjecture. He says that there
were, besides the two figures above mentioned, &quot;vn autre homme
et femme à genoux, comme s&#39;ils demandoient raison de la mort de
leur enfant, qui est vne antiquité de grand remarque dont je ne
puis donner autre certitude de l&#39;histoire.&quot; <EM>Antiquitez
de Caen</EM>; p.39. Now, it is this additional portion of the group
(at present no longer in existence) which should seem to confirm
the conjecture of my friend Mr. Douce--that it is a representation
of the received story, in the middle ages, of the Emperor Trajan
being met by a widow who demanded justice against the murderer of
her son. The Emperor, who had just mounted his horse to set out
upon some hostile expedition, replied, that &quot;he would listen
to her on his return.&quot; The woman said, &quot;What, if you
never return?&quot; &quot;My successor will satisfy you&quot;--he
replied--&quot;But how will that benefit you,&quot;--resumed the
widow. The Emperor then descended from his horse, and enquiring
into the woman&#39;s case, caused justice to be done to her. Some
of the stories say that the murderer was the Emperor&#39;s own
son.</P>

Rouen, Toulouse, Avignon, Narbonne, Montpelier, Lyons, Amiens,
Chartres, Angiers, Bayeux, Constances, (qu. Coutances?) and those
of St. Stephen at Caen, and others, in divers parts of France,
which are built in a pyramidal form--but THIS TOWER OT ST. PETER

form of construction.&quot; <EM>Antiq. de Caen</EM>; p.36. He
regrets, however, that the <EM>name of the architect</EM> has not
descended to us. [It is right to correct an error, in the preceding
edition, which has been committed on the authority of Ducarel. That
Antiquary supposed the tower and spire to have been built by the
generosity of one NICHOLAS, an ENGLISHMAN.&quot; Mons. Licquet has,

volumes of topography are invaluable--as preserving the memory of
things and of objects, which, but for such record, had perished
without the hope or chance of recovery.</P>

perhaps of its kind, one of the most perfect things extant. In
saying this, I only deliver the opinions of very many competent
judges. It must however be noticed, that the Society of Antiquaries
published the whole series of this exceedingly curious and ancient
Representation of the Conquest of our Country by William I. Of this
publication, the figures measure about four inches in height: but
there is also a complete, and exceedingly successful fac-simile of
the first two figures of this series-- of the size of the originals
(William I. and the Messenger coming to announce to him the landing
of Harold in England) also published from the same quarter. The
whole of these Drawings were from the pencil of the late ingenious
and justly lamented THOS. STOTHARD, Esq. Draftsman to the Society
of Antiquaries.]</P>

<P><A name="fn_149"></A><A href="#fnref_149">149</A> Of a monument,
which has been pronounced by one of our ablest antiquaries to be
&quot;THE NOBLEST IN THE WORLD RELATING TO OUR OLD ENGLISH
HISTORY,&quot; (See <EM>Stukely&#39;s Palæog. Britan.</EM> Number
XI. 1746, 4to. p. 2- 3) it may be expected that some archæological
discussion should be here subjoined. Yet I am free to confess that,
after the essays of Messrs. Gurney, Stothard, and Amyot, (and more
especially that of the latter gentleman) the matter--as to the
period of its execution--may be considered as well nigh, if not
wholly, at rest. These essays appear in the XVIIIth and XIXth
volumes of the Archæologia. The Abbé de la Rue contended that this
Tapestry was worked in the time of the second Matilda, or the
Empress Maud, which would bring it to the earlier part of the XIIth
century. The antiquaries above mentioned contend, with greater
probability, that it is a performance of the period which it
professes to commemorate; namely, of the defeat of Harold at the
battle of Hastings, and consequently of the acquiring of the Crown
of England, by conquest, on the part of William. This latter
therefore brings it to the period of about 1066, to 1088--so that,
after all, the difference of opinion is only whether this Tapestry
be fifty years older or younger, than the respective advocates
contend.</P>

<P>But the most copious, particular, and in my humble judgment the
most satisfactory, disquisition upon the date of this singular
historical monument, is entitled, &quot;<EM>A Defence of the early
Antiquity of the Bayeux Tapestry</EM>,&quot; by Thomas Amyot, Esq.
immediately following Mr. Stothard&#39;s communication, in the work
just referred to. It is at direct issue with all the hypotheses of
the Abbé de la Rue, and in my opinion the results are triumphantly
established. Whether the <EM>Normans</EM> or the <EM>English</EM>
worked it, is perfectly a secondary consideration. The chief
objections, taken by the Abbé, against its being a production of
the XIth century, consist in, first, its not being mentioned among
the treasures possessed by the Conqueror at his decease:--secondly,
that, if the Tapestry were deposited in the church, it must have
suffered, if not have been annihilated, at the storming of Bayeux
and the destruction of the Cathedral by fire in the reign of Henry
I., A.D. 1106:--thirdly, the silence of <EM>Wace</EM> upon the
subject,--who wrote his metrical histories nearly a century after
the Tapestry is supposed to have been executed.&quot; The latter is
chiefly insisted upon by the learned Abbé; who, which ever champion
come off victorious in this archæological warfare, must at any rate
receive the best thanks of the antiquary for the methodical and
erudite manner in which he has conducted his attacks.</P>

<P>At the first blush it cannot fail to strike us that the Abbé de
la Rue&#39;s positions are all of a <EM>negative</EM> character;
and that, according to the strict rules of logic, it must not be
admitted, that because such and such writers have <EM>not</EM>
noticed a circumstance, therefore that circumstance or event cannot
have taken place. The first two grounds of objection have, I think,
been fairly set aside by Mr. Amyot. As to the third objection, Mr.
A. remarks--&quot;But it seems that Wace has not only <EM>not</EM>
quoted the tapestry, but has varied from it in a manner which
proves that he had never seen it. The instances given of this
variation are, however, a little unfortunate. The first of them is
very unimportant, for the difference merely consists in placing a
figure at the <EM>stern</EM> instead of the <EM>prow</EM> of a
ship, and in giving him a bow instead of a trumpet. From an
authority quoted by the Abbé himself, it appears that, with regard
to this latter fact, the Tapestry was right, and Wace was wrong;
and thus an argument is unintentionally furnished in favour of the
superior antiquity of the Tapestry. The second instance of
variation, namely, that relating to Taillefer&#39;s sword, may be
easily dismissed; since, after all, it now appears, from Mr.
Stothard&#39;s examination, that neither Taillefer nor his sword is
to be found in the Tapestry,&quot; &amp;c. But it is chiefly from
the names of ÆLFGYVA and WADARD, inscribed over some of the
figures, that I apprehend the conclusion in favour of the
Tapestry&#39;s being nearly a contemporaneous production, may be
safely drawn.</P>

<P>It is quite clear that these names belong to persons living when
the work was in progress, or within the recollection of the
workers, and that they were attached to persons of some particular
note or celebrity, or rather perhaps of <EM>local</EM> importance.
An eyewitness, or a contemporary only would have introduced them.
They would not have lived in the memory of a person, whether
mechanic or historian, who lived a <EM>century</EM> after the
event. No antiquary has yet fairly appropriated these names, and
more especially the second. It follows therefore that they would
not have been introduced had they not been in existence at the
time; and in confirmation of that of WADARD, it seems that Mr.
Henry Ellis (Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries)
&quot;confirmed Mr. Amyot&#39;s conjecture on that subject, by the
references with which he furnished him to <EM>Domesday Book</EM>,
where his name occurs in no less than six counties, as holding
lands of large extent under <EM>Odo</EM>, Bishop of Bayeux, the
tenant in capite of those properties from the crown. That he was
not a <EM>guard</EM> or <EM>centinel,</EM> as the Abbé de la Rue
supposes, but that he held an <EM>office of rank</EM> in the
household of either William or Odo, seems now decided beyond a
doubt.&quot; Mr. Amyot thus spiritedly concludes:--alluding to the
successful completion of Mr. Stothard&#39;s copy of the entire
original roll.--&quot;Yet if the BAYEUX TAPESTRY be not history of
the first class, it is perhaps something better. It exhibits
general traits, elsewhere sought in vain, of the costume and
manners of that age, which, of all others, if we except the period
of the Reformation, ought to be the most interesting to us;--that
age, which gave us a new race of monarchs, bringing with them new
landholders, new laws, and almost a new language.&quot;</P>

<P>Mr. Amyot has subjoined a specimen of his own poetical powers in
describing &quot;the Minstrel TAILLEFER&#39;S achievements,&quot;
in the battle of Hastings, from the old Norman lays of GAIMAR and
WACE. I can only find room for the first few verses. The poem is
entitled,</P>

<P class="poetry">THE ONSET OF TAILLEFER.</P>

admitted could not be considered as very faithful) he returned it

<P><A name="fn_162"></A><A href="#fnref_162">162</A> The present
seems to be the proper place to give the reader some account of
this once famous Bacchanalian poet. It is not often that France
rests her pretensions to poetical celebrity upon such claims. Love,
romantic adventures, gaiety of heart and of disposition, form the
chief materials of her minor poems; but we have here before us, in
the person and productions of OLIVIER BASSELIN, a rival to ANACREON
of old; to our own RICHARD BRAITHWAIT, VINCENT BOURNE, and THOMAS
MOORE. As this volume may not be of general notoriety, the reader
may be prepared to receive an account of its contents with the
greater readiness and satisfaction. First, then, of the life and
occupations of Olivier Basselin; which, as Goujet has entirely
passed over all notice of him, we can gather only from the editors
of the present edition of his works. Basselin appears to have been
a <EM>Virois</EM>; in other words, an inhabitant of the town of
Vire. But he had a strange propensity to rusticating, and preferred
the immediate vicinity of Vire--its quiet little valleys, running
streams, and rocky recesses--to a more open and more distant
residence. In such places, therefore, he carried with him his
flasks of cider and his flagons of wine. Thither he resorted with
his &quot;boon and merry companions,&quot; and there he poured
forth his ardent and unpremeditated strains. These
&quot;strains&quot; all savoured of the jovial propensities of
their author; it being very rarely that tenderness of sentiment,
whether connected with friendship or love, is admitted into his
compositions. He was the thorough-bred Anacreon of France at the
close of the fifteenth century.</P>

<P>The town of Vire, as the reader may have already had intimation,
is the chief town of that department of Normandy called the BOCAGE;
and in this department few places have been, of old, more
celebrated than the <EM>Vaux de Vire</EM>; on account of the number
of manufactories which have existed there from time immemorial. It
derives its name from two principal valleys, in the form of a T, of
which the base (if it may be so called--&quot;jambage&quot;) rests
upon the <EM>Place du Chateau de Vire</EM>. It is sufficiently
contiguous to the town to be considered among the fauxbourgs. The
rivers <EM>Vire</EM> and <EM>Viréne</EM>, which unite at the bridge
of Vaux, run somewhat rapidly through the valleys. These rivers are
flanked by manufactories of paper and cloth, which, from the XVth
century, have been distinguished for their prosperous condition.
Indeed, BASSELIN himself was a sort of cloth manufacturer. In this
valley he passed his life in fulling his cloths, and &quot;in
composing those gay and delightful songs which are contained in the
volume under consideration.&quot; <EM>Discours Préliminaire</EM>,
p. 17, &amp;c. Olivier Basselin is the parent of the title
<EM>Vaudevire--</EM> which has since been corrupted into
<EM>Vaudeville</EM>. From the observation of his critics, Basselin
appears to have been the FATHER of BACCHANALIAN POETRY in France.
He frequented public festivals, and was a welcome guest at the
tables of the rich; where the Vaudevire was in such request, that
it is supposed to have superseded the &quot;Conte, or Fabliau, or
the Chanson d&#39;Amour.&quot;<A name="fnref_B"></A><A href=

<P>The poetry of Basselin is almost wholly devoted to the
celebration of the physical effects of wine upon the body and
animal spirits; and the gentler emotions of the TENDER PASSION are
rarely described in his numbers. In consequence, he has not invoked
the Goddess of Beauty to associate with the God of Wine: to</P>

<P class="poetry">&quot;Drop from her myrtle one leaf in his
bowl;&quot;</P>

<P>or, when he does venture to introduce the society of a female,
it is done after the following fashion--which discovers however an
extreme facility and melody of rhythm. The burden of the song seems
wonderfully accordant with a Bacchanalian note.</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;Après avoir deshonoré l&#39;habit des
femmes, elles ont encore voulu prostituer CELUI DES HOMMES. On les
a vues adopter successivement les chapeaux, les redingotes, les
vestes, les gilets, les bottes et jusqu&#39;aux boutons. Enfin si,
au lieu de jupons, elles avaient pu s&#39;accommoder de l&#39;usage
de la culotte, la métamorphose était complette; mais elles ont
préféré les robes traînantes; c&#39;est dommage que la nature ne
leur ait donné une troisième main, qui leur serait nécessaire pour
tenir cette longue queue, qui souvent patrouille la boue ou balaye
la poussière. Plût à Dieu que les anciennes lois fussent encore en
vigueur, ou ceux et celles qui portaient des habits indécent

teint frais et fleuri, l&#39;oeil vif, le visage vermeil, la
démarche leste, un air étoffé et très élégantes dans tout leur
maintien. Si on dit avec raison que les Bayeusines sont belles, les
filles du Bocage, qui sont leurs voisines, ne leur cèdent en aucune
manière, car en général le sang est très-beau en ce pays. Quant aux
talens spirituels, elles les possèdent à un dégré éminent. Elles
parlent avec aisance, ont le repartie prompte, et outre les soins
du ménage, ou elles excellent de telle sorte qu&#39;il n&#39;y a

<P>These passages, notwithstanding the amende honorable of the
concluding paragraph, raised a storm of indignation against the
unsuspecting author! Nor can we be surprised at it.</P>

<P>This publication is really filled with a great variety of
curious historical detail--throughout which is interspersed much
that relates to &quot;romaunt lore&quot; and romantic adventures.
The civil wars between MONTGOMERY and MATIGNON form alone a very
important and interesting portion of the volume; and it is evident
that the author has exerted himself with equal energy and anxiety
to do justice to both parties--except that occasionally he betrays
his antipathies against the Hugonots.<A name="fnref_D"></A><A href=
"#fn_D">D</A> I will quote the concluding passage of this work.
There may be at least half a score readers who may think it
something more than merely historically curious:</P>

<P class="quote">&quot;Je finirai donc ici mon Histoire. Je
n&#39;ai point parlé d&#39;un grand nombre des faits d&#39;armes et
d&#39;actions glorieuses, qui se sont passés dans la guerre de
l&#39;indépendance des Etats-Unis d&#39;Amérique où beaucoup de
Bocains ont eu part; mais mon principal dessein a été de traiter
des guerres qui ont eu lieu dans le Bocage; ainsi je crois avoir
atteint mon but, qui était d&#39;écrire l&#39;Histoire Militaire
des Bocains par des faits et non par des phrases, je ne peux
cependant omettre une circonstance glorieuse pour le Bocage;
c&#39;est la visite que le bon et infortuné Louis XVI. fit aux
Bocains en 1786. Ce grand Monarque dont les vues étaient aussi
sages que profondes, avait résolu de faire construire le beau Port
de Cherbourg, ouvrage vraiment Royal, qui est une des plus nobles
entreprises qui aient été faites depuis l&#39;origine de la
Monarchie. Les Bocains sentirent l&#39;avantage d&#39;un si grand
bienfait. Le Roi venant visiter les travaux, fut accueilli avec un
enthousiasme presqu&#39;impossible à décrire, ainsi que les Princes
qui l&#39;accompagnaient. Sa marche rassemblait à un triomphe. Les
peuples accouraient en foule du fond des campagnes, et bordaient la
route, faisant retentir les airs de chants d&#39;alégresse et des
cris millions de fois répétés de Vive le Roi! Musique, Processions,
Arcs de triomphe, Chemins jonchés de fleurs; tout fut prodigué. Les
villes de Caen, de Bayeux, de Saint-Lo, de Carentan, de Valognes,
se surpassérent dans cette occasion, pour prouver à S.M. leur amour
et leur reconnaissance; mais rien ne fut plus brillant que
l&#39;entrée de ce grand Roi à Cherbourg. Un peuple immense, le
clergé, toute la noblesse du pays, le son des cloches, le bruit du
canon, les acclamations universelles prouvérent au Monarque mieux
encore que la pompe toute Royale et les fêtes magnifiques que la
ville ne cessa de lui donner tous les jours, que les coeurs de tous
les Bocains étaient à lui.&quot; p. 428.</P>

<P><A name="fn_170"></A><A href="#fnref_170">170</A> The worthy
historian of Falaise, quoted in a preceding page, is exceedingly
anxious to make us believe that there are portions of this
church--namely, four stones--in the eastern and western gable
ends--which were used in the consecration of it, by MATHILDA, the
wife of our first William. Also, that, at the gable end of the
south transept, outside, an ancient grotto,--in which the Gallic
priests of old purified themselves for the mysteries of their
religion--is now converted into the sacristy, or vestry, or robing
room. But these are surely mere antiquarian dreams. The same author
more sagaciously informs us that the exact period of the
commencement of the building of the nave, namely in 1438, is yet
attested by an existing inscription, in gothic letters, towards the
chief door of entrance. The inscription also testifies that in the
same year, &quot;there reigned DEATH, WAR, and FAMINE.&quot; The
<EM>chancel of the choir</EM>, with the principal doors of
entrance, &amp;c. were constructed between the years 1520, and
1540. It may be worth remarking that the stalls of the choir were
brought from the Abbey of St. John--on the destruction of that
monastic establishment in 1729; and that, according to the
<EM>Gallia Christiana</EM>, vol. xi. p. 756, these stalls were
carved at the desire of Thomas II. de Mallebiche, abbot of that
establishment in 1506-1516. In a double niche of the south buttress
are the statues of HERPIN and his WIFE; rich citizens of Falaise,
who, by their wealth, greatly contributed to the building of the
choir. (Their grandson, HERPIN LACHENAYE, together with his
mistress were killed, side by side, in fighting at one of the gates
of Falaise to repel the successful troops of Henry IV.) The
<EM>Chapel of the Virgin</EM>, behind the choir, was completed
about the year 1631. LANGEVIN, p. 81-128-131.</P>

<P><A name="fn_171"></A><A href="#fnref_171">171</A> We have of
course nothing to do with the first erection of a place of worship
at Guibray in the VIIIth century. The story connected with the
earliest erection is this. The faubourg of Guibray, distant about
900 paces from Falaise, was formerly covered with chestnut and oak
trees. A sheep, scratching the earth, as if by natural instinct (I
quote the words of M. Langevin the historian of Falaise) indicated,
by its bleatings, that something was beneath. The shepherd
approached, and hollowing out the earth with his crook, discovered
a statue of the Virgin, with a child in its arms. The first church,
dedicated to the Virgin, under the reign of Charles Martel, called
the Victorious, was in consequence erected--on this very spot--in
the centre of this widely spreading wood of chestnut and oak. I
hasten to the construction of a second church, on the same site,
under the auspices of Mathilda, the wife of the Conqueror: with the
statue of a woman with a diadem upon her head--near one of the
pillars: upon which statue Langevin discourses learnedly in a note.
But neither this church nor the statue in question are now in
existence. On the contrary, the oldest portions of the church of
Guibray, now existing--according to the authors of the <EM>Gallia
Christiana</EM>, vol. xi. p. 878, and an ancient MS. consulted by
M. Langevin--are of about the date of 1222; when the church was
consecrated by the Bishop of Coutances. The open space towards the
south, now called <EM>La Place aux Chevaux</EM>, was the old
burying ground of the church. There was also a chapel, dedicated to
St. Gervais, which was pillaged and destroyed by the Hugonots in
1562. I should add, that the South-East exterior (behind the
chancel) of this very curious old church at Guibray, resembles,
upon a small scale, what M. Cotman has published of the same
portion of St. Georges de Bocherville. <EM>Recherches sur
Falaise</EM>, p. 49-53. Monsieur le Comte de la Fresnaye, in his
<EM>Notice Historique sur Falaise</EM>, 1816, 8vo. will have it,
that &quot;the porch of this church, the only unmutilated portion
remaining of its ancient structure, demonstrates the epoch of the
origin of Christianity among the Gauls.&quot; &quot;At least, such
is the decision of M. Deveze, draftsman for Laborde; the latter of
whom now Secretary to the Count d&#39;Artois, instituted a close
examination of the whole fabric.&quot; p. 5-6. I hope there are not
many such conclusions to be found in the magnificent and
meritorious productions of LABORDE.</P>

<P><A name="fn_172"></A><A href="#fnref_172">172</A> This fair
lasts full fifteen days. The first eight days are devoted to
business of a more important nature--which they call the GREAT
WEEK: that is to say, the greatest number of merchants attend
during the earlier part of it; and contracts of greater extent
necessarily take place. The remaining seven days are called the
LITTLE WEEK--in which they make arrangements to carry their
previous bargains into effect, and to return home. Men and
merchandise, from all quarters, and of all descriptions, are to be
seen at this fair. Even Holland and Germany are not wanting in
sending their commercial representatives. Jewellery and grocery
seem to be the chief articles of commerce; but there is a
prodigious display of silk, linen, and cotton, &amp;c.: as well as
of hides, raw and tanned; porcelaine and earthen ware. The live
cattle market must not be forgotten. Langevin says that, of horses
alone, they sometimes sell full four thousand. Thus much for the
buyer and seller. But this fair is regularly enlivened by an
immense confluence of nobility and gentry from the adjacent
country--to partake of the amusements, which, (as with the
English,) form the invariable appendages of the scene. Langevin
mentions the minor fairs of <EM>Ste. Croix, St. Michel</EM>, and
<EM>St. Gervais</EM>, which help to bring wealth into the pockets
of the inhabitants. <EM>Recherches Historiques sur Falaise</EM>; p.

hardly justifiable--taste, to quote that notice: yet I cannot
dissemble the satisfaction to find that there is <EM>more</EM> than

of its excellence. I subjoin, therefore, with the greatest

these thrusts have been parried; and if the &quot;hits&quot; on the

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
